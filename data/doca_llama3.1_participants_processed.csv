* The main issue being protested is the excessive use of salt on roads during winter, which is causing environmental damage and health concerns.
* The protest is led by Bedford residents and officials, who are demanding that the State Department of Transportation change its road-salting practices.
* The protesters argue that sand should be used instead of salt, as it provides traction without causing harm to vegetation or contaminating drinking water supplies.
* Some highway superintendents are also protesting the use of salt, citing concerns about its environmental impact and the risk of accidents caused by slippery roads.
* A 1983 county study found that the use of salt doubled every five or six years, leading to growing concerns about its long-term effects on the environment and human health.

Concerns:

* Environmental damage: The excessive use of salt is causing harm to vegetation, including grass and trees along roadways.
* Health concerns: High levels of sodium in drinking water supplies are a concern for people on restricted diets.
* Accidents: The use of salt can cause slippery roads, leading to accidents and injuries.

Solutions:

* Using sand instead of salt
* Improving storage facilities to reduce salt spills and contamination
* Conducting studies to reduce or eliminate the use of salt on certain roads
* Using liquid calcium in combination with salt to make it more efficient and reduce its use

1. **Real estate pressures**: The Hasidic community is growing and needs more space to expand their homes and institutions. This has led to aggressive efforts by Hasidim to purchase homes and churches owned by black residents.
2. **Harassment allegations**: Black residents complain that they receive constant calls and mailers from Hasidim asking them to sell, which they find annoying and harassing.
3. **Security patrol controversy**: The Crown Heights Jewish Community Council has established an all-white volunteer security patrol, which some see as a vigilante squad that disproportionately targets black residents.
4. **Community development grants**: A majority of the $295,138 in community development agency grants goes to Hasidic organizations, while black-controlled groups receive less funding.
5. **Power dynamics**: Many blacks feel powerless and resentful due to the perceived lack of representation and influence in the neighborhood's decision-making processes.

* ""What is called crime in any other neighborhood is called racial tension here."" - Rabbi Yisroel Rosenfeld, director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council

The disturbance involved hundreds of inmates who broke windows, threw burning mattresses from windows, and destroyed approximately 600 beds to create weapons. The prison's perimeter was surrounded by fire trucks, ambulances, and specially trained emergency correction officials armed with machine guns and shotguns.

The riot did not occur simultaneously in all dormitories, suggesting that it may have been planned. However, the authorities' use of force was minimal compared to previous uprisings on Rikers Island. The disturbance was led by inmates who had returned to New York City on parole and were then arrested for another offense, typically involving more serious crimes.

The cause of the riot was attributed to the state's failure to claim its rightful inmates, leading to overcrowding and tensions in the city's jails. The event highlighted the need for effective management of state prisoners in city facilities and led to calls for their transfer to upstate prisons where they would have more space, programs, and opportunities to work.

Key points:

* Hundreds of inmates participated in the riot
* Inmates broke windows, threw burning mattresses, and destroyed beds to create weapons
* The perimeter was surrounded by fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency officials armed with machine guns and shotguns
* The use of force was minimal compared to previous uprisings on Rikers Island
* The disturbance was led by inmates who had returned to New York City on parole and were then arrested for another offense

The article highlights the work of the Mercer Council on Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, which is working with four hospitals to identify and counsel mothers who are at risk of having children with FAS. The council has received a $70,000 grant from the state and has posted warning signs in places that sell alcohol, urging pregnant women to abstain.

Finally, the article discusses the new Federal law requiring alcohol labels to carry a warning about the risks of drinking during pregnancy. The Distilled Spirits Council and other trade groups representing the alcohol industry have expressed concerns about the labeling requirements, advocating for an educational approach instead.

1. Exposure to American culture and values through exchange programs has had a significant impact on Chinese students' perceptions of democracy.
2. Students have been reading novels and Reader's Digest, listening to Voice of America broadcasts, and interacting with American students and teachers, which has shaped their views on freedom and individual rights.
3. The seeds of the democracy movement were sown in the early 1980s when translated Western books began to be published in Beijing, sparking discussions about democracy and change.
4. Students envision a multiparty system that would protect Chinese people from dictators and ensure fair representation.
5. They are demanding free speech, freedom of association, fair coverage of news, and laws being upheld fairly.
6. Corruption among government officials is seen as a major issue, with students condemning its existence at all levels.

8907088,270505,"The New Jersey Audubon Society has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Environmental Protection, alleging that the regulations adopted by the department go beyond the legislative intent and unfairly benefit developers.

One of the key issues is the grandfather clause exemption, which was originally set to expire on July 1, 1988. However, the final regulations extended this exemption period to July 3, 1989. The environmental group argues that this extension was not authorized by the Legislature and has resulted in unfair advantages for developers.

Developers, on the other hand, argue that the grandfather clause exemption is not an exemption at all, but rather a clarification of the original intent behind the legislation. They claim that projects that received preliminary approval from municipalities before July 3, 1989, were always intended to be exempt from transition-area requirements.

The controversy surrounding the buffer regulations has led to concerns about the impact on development in the state. Some developers are facing costly redesigns and revisions to accommodate the new regulations, which could ultimately affect the public as well.

Environmentalists, however, believe that the regulations have a crucial role to play in protecting the environment. They argue that the transition zones provide important ecological benefits, such as flood protection and habitat preservation.

The issue is likely to be litigated extensively, with many developers considering lawsuits against the Department of Environmental Protection. Some attorneys are already warning that the state's new regulations could lead to a wave of litigation, potentially ranging into the hundreds.

There are hundreds of towns in three Southern states that are affected by the court ruling.

In Montgomery, Ala., last week, Mayor Emory Folmar and William Joseph Jr., chairman of the Montgomery County Commissioners, marched to the 50-yard line in Cramton Bowl and led a prayer before the first game of the year there.

Six people protested the organized prayer by making noises. One of them was arrested after scuffling with a police officer who was trying to take away his air horn.

Reports of other schools in Alabama that went ahead with prayers, and several schools in Georgia say they plan to do so this weekend. But a vast majority of districts have grudgingly gone along with the court ruling.

Several major radio stations last week aired one-minute prayers before their football broadcasts. Several Georgia stations plan to follow suit.

In Sylacouga, Ala., ministers say they plan to continue nonsanctioned prayers that began last week when they rose in the bleachers and led a crowd of 3,000 in the Lord's Prayer.

8909032,282861,"The Helms amendment is a controversial proposal that aims to restrict the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from supporting artistic projects that some members of Congress consider obscene or indecent. Representative Rohrabacher, a staunch conservative, is leading the effort to adopt the Helms amendment and has been preparing for a possible showdown with his colleagues.

The amendment was originally passed in the Senate, but now it must be reconciled with a House version that does not include the same restrictions. Representative Yates, a Democrat, has agreed to move to instruct the conferees to adopt a Senate amendment unrelated to the Helms proposal, which would prevent a vote on the Helms amendment and spare his colleagues from having to take a public stance.

However, Rohrabacher is prepared for this eventuality and plans to force a roll-call vote on the Helms amendment if necessary. He has been lining up support from conservative organizations and has prepared himself with the help of Representative Dannemeyer, a skilled practitioner of parliamentary tactics.

Rohrabacher's strategy involves framing the issue as a choice between ""Mom and apple pie"" and ""perversity,"" appealing to his colleagues' sense of moral outrage. He also plans to use the media to his advantage, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of Democrats who support the NEA despite its alleged promotion of obscene art.

The stakes are high, and Rohrabacher's colleagues are aware that opposing him could lead to negative consequences in their home districts. The National Republican Congressional Committee has already sent press releases to the news media in vulnerable districts, labeling Democrats who vote against the Helms amendment as supporters of ""federally subsidized obscenity.""

The battle over the Helms amendment is expected to be intense and may even involve personal attacks on lawmakers who vote against it. Senator Helms, the original sponsor of the amendment, has already begun dramatizing his position by sending prints of explicit artwork to Senate conferees, accompanied by a letter that implies taxpayers should not fund such content.

In the end, the outcome of this battle will depend on the ability of Rohrabacher and his allies to mobilize public opinion and create pressure on lawmakers to take a stand. The fight is far from over, and it remains to be seen whether the Helms amendment will ultimately be adopted or defeated.",

* Both FBG and HEAT have around 1,500 members in Westchester County.

**Critics of fuel cooperatives:**

* Some critics warn that service can be erratic and additional charges may be levied for service contracts on heating systems.

**Government response:**

* The New York Oil Heating Association blames a ""confluence of events"" (including cold weather) for high prices.
* Robert Greenes, the association's government affairs and public relations section head, suggests that prices will soon drop.

**Impact on consumers:**

* Some consumers are seeking alternatives to high-priced oil companies, such as fuel cooperatives.
* Westchester County Legislator Paul J. Feiner notes that these cooperatives can send a message to oil companies to reduce rates.

9001039,315385,"The Metro Broadcasting case is a significant one, as it involves the interpretation of Congressional intent and the constitutional authority of Congress to enact affirmative action programs.

In Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980), the Supreme Court upheld a Federal public works program that set aside 10% of available funds for minority contractors, citing Congress's special authority under the Constitution to enact such programs. This precedent has been questioned in recent years, particularly after the Richmond v. Croson decision (1989), which struck down a similar contracting program implemented by the City Council of Richmond.

The Metro Broadcasting case represents an opportunity for the Court to re-examine this precedent and potentially revisit the Fullilove ruling. The fact that the commission's affirmative action program has had limited success in increasing minority ownership of broadcast outlets adds complexity to the issue.

It will be interesting to see how the Court approaches this case, given the potential implications for Federal affirmative action programs as a whole.",

The ordination was met with opposition from a traditionalist group, the Episcopal Synod of America, who demonstrated inside and outside the church.

The article highlights that this ordination is significant because it comes after the General Convention of the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1979 stating that it was ""not appropriate"" to ordain homosexuals to the priesthood. Bishop Spong maintained that the resolution was only advisory and that he had conducted a thorough screening process before ordaining Mr. Williams.

The article also reports on Robert Williams' views on sexual matters, including his belief that monogamy is not essential for a valid Christian relationship. He made these comments in a presentation at a Detroit church, which drew criticism from some quarters. Bishop Spong later distanced himself from these remarks and demanded Mr. Williams' resignation from the Oasis, a community he founded.

The article concludes by noting that Robert Williams has refused to resign as a priest or cease functioning in his role despite the demands of Bishop Spong and others.

**1989**: The New Jersey State Police arrested and charged 10,132 individuals with drunk driving, while another 2,872 individuals were tested with the Breathalyzer and released without being charged.

**1990s**: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged police practices on sobriety checkpoints, also known as ""D.W.I. roadblocks."" In two cases, the ACLU was successful in challenging the constitutionality of these roadblocks.

**2000s**: A debate emerged about the use of Breathalyzer readings as the sole means of proving a person has been driving while intoxicated. The New Jersey Supreme Court decided to hear appeals on this topic in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision that held that if a state legislature ""packs"" an offense with other penalties, then under certain circumstances, a defendant might be entitled to a trial by jury.

**2010s**: In January, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that any errors inherent in calculating Breathalyzer results were acceptable and that they could continue to be used as the only evidence necessary to support a conviction for drunken driving. This decision sparked further protests about the use of Breathalyzers and sobriety checkpoints.

Some notable protesters include:

* Edward Martone, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Jersey, who has long been opposed to sobriety checkpoints.
* Anthony J. Parenti, president of the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police, who prefers roving patrols over sobriety checkpoints.

**Penalties for drunk driving in New Jersey:**

1st Offense:
	* Up to 30 days imprisonment
	* 6 months to 1 year license revocation
	* 12 hours in intoxicated driver's resource center
	* $250 to $400 fine
	* $100 enforcement surcharge
	* Insurance surcharge of $1,000/year for 3 years
	* Up to 35% increase in insurance premium

	* $500 to $1,000 fine

9003019,333630,"The article discusses the issue of airplane noise affecting communities in New Jersey, particularly those living under air traffic routes operated by Newark Airport. The Antinoise Coalition, which represents thousands of residents, claims that more than 1,000 square miles of the state are covered by airline routes, causing significant noise pollution.

Residents from various towns and cities, including Boonton, Allendale, Colts Neck, Hunterdon, Somerset, and Ironbound district, have reported being disturbed by the constant jet noise. Some residents claim to have seen planes flying as low as 3,000 feet, making it possible to read the airline's name on the fuselage.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey defends the plan, stating that the FAA has made efforts to adjust routes to reduce noise in affected communities. However, critics argue that these changes have merely shifted the noise from one community to another, with some residents experiencing even greater disturbance.

Concerns about property values, environmental impact, and quality of life are also raised by residents. Some have already moved away due to the unbearable noise, while others are considering doing so. The coalition is pushing for measures such as curfews, quieter aircraft, or newer models to mitigate the effects of noise pollution.

The article also mentions pending legislation at both state and federal levels aimed at addressing the issue. The Antinoise Coalition is urging Governor Jim Florio to file a lawsuit against the aviation agency and may even proceed with its own litigation if necessary.

The company has been hit hard by the Navy's decision to reduce production of its fast-attack submarines and the Department of Energy's decision to give all future marine reactor work to Babcock & Wilcox.

The article mentions that the town of Montville is heavily dependent on military spending, with many residents commuting to Electric Boat submarine shipyard in nearby Groton or working at UNC. The layoffs at UNC have had a significant impact on the local economy, and there are concerns about the potential loss of tax base and the displacement of workers.

The article also mentions that the company will offer job counseling and support services to laid-off workers, but the vice president for human resources is pessimistic about the prospects of finding new jobs. He notes that the average length of service at the company is 13 years, suggesting a high level of employee loyalty.

Some quotes from employees include:

* ""The defense workers of America have paid the premiums of peace through their labor and efforts and dedication, but the peace dividend is going to be paid overseas... That dividend should be turned around and put back into the defense industry for retooling. It's only fair."" - James B. Rusiecki, a supervisor of electronic technologies
* ""We feel that some of the money that's being saved in defense should come back to us."" - Charla McDermott, a UNC quality-control worker

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by workers and communities affected by defense budget cuts, particularly those who have been reliant on military spending for their livelihoods.",

The trial was marked by surreal moments, including Mrs. Marcos breaking down in tears and collapsing due to stress.

The prosecution argued that Mrs. Marcos knew about her husband's corrupt activities and profited from them, while the defense claimed she was unaware of the illegal transactions. The jury ultimately found Mrs. Marcos not guilty on all counts, with one juror reportedly swaying the verdict by refusing to convict her.

The trial raised broader questions about corruption and abuse of power under the Marcos regime, as well as the hypocrisy of the United States government in supporting Mr. Marcos while indicting his wife after his death. The case highlighted the challenges of prosecuting a complex web of illegal transactions spanning multiple countries and jurisdictions.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""What this trial has established before the world is what the Marcos regime was all about - unbridled corruption and a total abuse of power."" - Mrs. Pedrosa
* ""This just proves that a single juror has more power than the United States Government itself."" - Gerry Spence, defense attorney

* Colleges and universities have been criticized for not providing sensitive treatment of the problem or clear avenues for reporting sexual assault.

The National Institutes of Health has found that most biomedical research is conducted on men, excluding women from studies. In response, lawmakers and advocacy groups are pushing for more attention to be paid to breast cancer.

The article highlights the work of Representative Mary Rose Oakar, who sponsored several bills related to breast cancer research and treatment. She notes that by comparing the funding for breast cancer research to that for AIDS research, she was able to garner support from lawmakers whose wives had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

The article also discusses the demographics of the issue, noting that the baby boom has led to a larger population of women in their 40s, who are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. This demographic shift has helped to politicize breast cancer, with many women becoming involved in advocacy efforts.

The Komen Foundation for Breast Cancer and the Women's Cancer Resource Center are mentioned as examples of groups that have been instrumental in pushing for increased research funding and improved treatment options.

The article also explores the roots of inspiration for the current wave of activism around breast cancer. It notes that the feminist movement of the 1960s emphasized women's control over their own bodies and health, which has led to a greater awareness of women's health issues more broadly.

The article highlights the parallels between the AIDS movement and the breast cancer movement, noting that both have been driven by activism and advocacy efforts. It quotes Elenore Pred, founder of Breast Cancer Action, as saying that ""AIDS has created a terrible, wonderful model for us all.""

Finally, the article notes that women's health organizations are also becoming more involved in advocating for breast cancer research and treatment. The American Association of University Women is mentioned as an example, having endorsed legislation related to women's health issues.

Overall, this article suggests that the growing awareness and activism surrounding breast cancer research and treatment is driven by a combination of demographic factors, feminist principles, and parallels with other social movements (such as the AIDS movement).",

9102007,421074,"As educators and parents, we should provide young people with the tools they need to make informed decisions about their sexual health. This includes comprehensive sexuality education, access to condoms, and guidance on how to use them effectively.

The argument against distributing condoms in schools is based on a flawed assumption that doing so will encourage promiscuity among teenagers. However, research suggests that providing condoms and information about safe sex practices can actually reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Furthermore, as Andrew J. Humm pointed out, young people are already engaging in sexual activity regardless of whether they receive education or condoms. Therefore, it is our responsibility to provide them with the knowledge and tools they need to make informed decisions about their sexual health.

It's important to recognize that providing condoms and sexuality education does not condone or encourage promiscuity. Rather, it empowers young people to take control of their own bodies and make responsible choices about their sexual health.

As Erica Zurer pointed out, as parents, we cannot control our children's behavior, but we can provide them with the tools and guidance they need to make informed decisions. Similarly, educators should be empowered to provide comprehensive sexuality education and condom distribution programs that promote healthy decision-making among young people.

By providing condoms and sexuality education, we can help reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and STIs, and empower young people to make responsible choices about their sexual health. This is not an act of desperation or a means of promoting promiscuity, but rather a moral obligation to protect the health and well-being of our children.",

One student, Mr. McKenzie, chose to live in a predominantly black dorm during his first year at Stanford, citing self-affirmation as his reason for doing so. He later moved out of the dorm and now lives in a residence hall with many Hispanic students.

The article also mentions Troy Duster's research on campus diversity, which found that as minority enrollment rose, racial awareness intensified, leading to segregation among students. Dr. Duster recommends that universities do more to unite students during their first six months on campus and encourage interaction across racial and ethnic lines.

Stanford's model of having four special ethnic dorms, with a twist of not allowing more than half the residents to belong to the theme group, is seen as a potential solution to this issue. The article highlights Casa Zapata, a Hispanic-themed dorm at Stanford, where students from different cultural backgrounds live together and share common experiences.

The novel pressure cooker process heats and destroys solid-rocket fuel in a cloud of dense steam, using oxidation as a means to break down the material. This method is seen as holding promise for large-scale application.

The Air Force is also investigating other innovative ways to recycle or destroy missiles, including the use of super-cold liquid nitrogen to rapidly reduce solid fuel to a powder that can be processed or recycled. Additionally, anaerobic microorganisms are being explored as a means to digest some dilute components of rocket fuel, converting it into a simple salt.

In Iraq, United Nations personnel destroyed Iraqi missiles using pulverization with a heavy weight, a process that involved breaking down the aft and front ends of the missile casings.

The retirement of American missiles under the START treaty is expected to increase in the near future. The question now being debated is what to do with the retired missiles, with some advocating for their conversion into civil and commercial launchers that could be used to loft small payloads into space.

Environmental groups are concerned about the potential impact on the ozone layer of a surge in small rockets. Experts are divided on the extent of the danger, but some believe that many of the retired missiles will end up being destroyed or recycled due to their age and unreliability.

**Mass Dismissals:**

9111038,487815,"The protest against the initial investigation of Julio Rivera's murder as drug-related was led by gay groups, who argued that the crime was motivated by hate due to Rivera's sexual orientation. The police eventually reclassified the crime as a bias incident after months of pressure from these groups.

Rivera's friends and family had always believed that he would never buy drugs on the street, and that his death was not related to drug use. His sister, Josie Rivera, recalled that Julio liked the best of everything and got it from the men in his life, which suggests that he may have been a victim of hate crime due to his sexual orientation.

The article highlights Julio's personality, interests, and relationships, showcasing his complex character beyond just being a gay man. His love for old classic movies, music, clothes, dancing, Halloween, and Broadway shows are all mentioned, giving insight into his passions and tastes.

In contrast, Daniel Doyle, the other victim, is portrayed as a more traditional and ""preppy"" individual. He came from a loving family with doting parents and sisters, which was very different from Julio's upbringing in the South Bronx. Daniel's friends described him as ""very smart, very sweet, very committed to his work,"" highlighting his academic achievements and personality.

The article also touches on the gang culture surrounding the murder of both victims. While some may associate DMS with neo-Nazi white supremacist groups due to its name, the article clarifies that many members are black, Asian, or Hispanic, and that the gang is known for a history of fighting, assault, robbery, and murder.

Overall, this article highlights the complex lives of two individuals who were tragically murdered, while also shedding light on the social issues surrounding their deaths.

The ordinance was used to charge two teenagers with disorderly conduct for burning a cross on someone's lawn.

Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, argues that the First Amendment is often tested with speech that is profoundly divisive or painful, and that making exceptions for ""hurtful"" speech could lead to suppressing free speech altogether.

Many legal experts expect a narrow ruling from the Supreme Court, focusing on who has the right to challenge a criminal law on the grounds that it discourages free speech. The court will likely construe the ordinance narrowly, applying only to ""fighting words"" that inflict injury or tend to incite immediate violence.

The case raises broad questions about the limits of free speech and the role of hate-crime laws in promoting tolerance and respect for diversity. Some civil libertarians argue that the St. Paul law is too broad and could be used to criminalize other forms of expression, such as art or political satire.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court case highlights the importance of balancing individual rights with community concerns about hate crimes. The court's decision will have significant implications for the limits of free speech and the role of government in promoting social justice and tolerance.",

2. The city currently exports much of its commercial waste to dumps from Pennsylvania to Montana.
3. Recycling accounts for less than 6 percent of New York's waste.

5. The city's sanitation commissioner, Mr. Polan, has stated that the city will have to burn at least 10,000 tons of garbage each day in several new or refurbished plants.

The main point of contention is the sale of large tracts of land to out-of-state buyers, which some argue is changing the character of the state and threatening its natural beauty.

Some of the key arguments made by opponents of the trend include:

* Selling off Montana's open spaces and ranches to out-of-staters who may not appreciate or respect the land's natural resources.
* The potential for over-development and destruction of wildlife habitats, as well as increased traffic and noise pollution.
* The loss of prime grazing land and the potential for more ghost retreats.

On the other hand, proponents of the trend argue that:

* Montana is still a vast and rural state with plenty of open space, and the sale of land to out-of-staters is not necessarily a bad thing.
* Many of these buyers are simply trying to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and preserve a piece of nature for themselves and their families.
* The trend is not necessarily a threat to Montana's natural resources or way of life, as many of these buyers do not use their land extensively and may even help to maintain the area's natural beauty.

She recalled being invited to reapply for her job twice, only to have the company change their minds again.

Samuel E. Hare, 25, had worked his way up at an outlet in Charlotte, N.C., and was training new workers. When he was asked if he was gay by a district manager, he replied ""yes."" He was then terminated on the spot.

George Frisbee, 26, who was also training new workers at a Cracker Barrel in Tallahassee, Fla., had an argument with a waitress about his homosexuality.

**Location:** The Supreme Court, Washington D.C.

**Date:** No specific date given; the article refers to events from ""six years ago"" (which would be around 1987) and mentions a recent Federal appeals court decision striking down a Guam law.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Abortion restrictions**: The Pennsylvania law requires a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well as informed consent and notification of husbands for married women.
2. **State interest in fetal life**: The Court is considering the constitutionality of the law and whether it serves a ""compelling"" state interest.
3. **Standard of review**: The justices are debating whether to apply strict scrutiny or a lower standard, such as rational basis or undue burden, to evaluate restrictions on abortion.

**Notable Quotes:**

1. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: ""The standard that this Court applies will establish the outcome in this case... To adopt a lesser standard, to abandon strict scrutiny for a less protective standard, would be the same as overruling Roe.""
2. Solicitor General Starr: ""Complete prohibition [of abortion] with no exception for the life of the mother"" would raise very serious questions.

**Related Cases:** The article mentions:

1. **Roe v. Wade**: A landmark 1973 case that established the right to abortion as fundamental.
2. **Webster v. Reproductive Health Services**: A 1989 case where Justice Anthony M. Kennedy advocated for a rational basis standard for abortion restrictions.
3. **Guam law**: A recent Federal appeals court decision striking down a Guam law making abortion a crime unless done to save the woman's life or prevent grave danger to her health.

Please note that this article is primarily about the Supreme Court case, rather than a protest per se. However, it does touch on the themes of reproductive rights and government intervention in personal decisions, which are often at the heart of protests related to abortion issues.",

In a significant decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that lawsuits against cigarette companies can proceed, despite claims of pre-emption by the industry. The ruling, which revives a case brought by the Cipollone family, holds that certain claims are not pre-empted by Federal laws regulating tobacco products.

The case, Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc., No. 90-1038, involves allegations that cigarette companies conspired to mislead the public and falsely advertise their products, causing harm to smokers like Mrs. Cipollone, who died of lung cancer in 1984.

The Court's ruling, written by Justice Stevens, found that some claims were pre-empted, but others were not. The non-pre-empted claims include allegations that cigarette companies breached a legal duty under state law and conspired to commit fraud.

The decision is significant because it allows smokers who have been harmed by the industry's alleged wrongdoing to pursue their cases in court. It also sets a precedent for other product liability lawsuits, where Federal laws require warning labels on products like food, alcohol, and children's pajamas.

The Court's ruling was not without controversy. Three factions emerged among the Justices, with Justice Stevens writing the plurality opinion that controlled the outcome of the case. The ruling was seen as creating a favorable climate for plaintiffs in smoking cases and beyond.

In related news, it is worth noting that three Supreme Court Justices (Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas) are smokers themselves.",

**Protest Name:** Ballot Measure 9 (anti-gay proposal)

**Location:** Oregon

**Date:** November 3 (ballot measure vote date)

**Organizer:** Lon Mabon, chair of the No Special Rights Committee

**Description:** The proposed amendment aims to ""discourage homosexuality, other listed 'behaviors,' and not facilitate or recognize them."" It lists pedophilia, sadism or masochism as the other ""behaviors"" alongside homosexuality.

**Opposition:** The No On 9 Committee, led by Sherry Oeser, argues that the measure would lead to a witch hunt of homosexuals, with thought police and investigators searching for people who speak favorably of them in state and local government. They also claim it would violate constitutional protections of free speech and allow discrimination against homosexuals.

**Legal Scholars' Views:** Many legal scholars consider the measure to be a clear violation of constitutional protections of free speech, citing guilt-by-association and censorship as concerns.

**Supporters:** The Catholic Church has come out against the measure, stating that it may contribute to attitudes of intolerance and hostility. Some gay-rights groups around the country are also opposing the measure.

2. Institute for the Advancement of Hawaiian Affairs (led by Hayden F. Burgess) - argues that the United States violated the self-determination provisions of the 1946 United Nations Charter when it made Hawaii a state in 1959 without offering the option of independence.
3. Ka Pakaukau (led by Dr. Kekuni Blaisdell) - a group of 12 organizations seeking independence.

**Protest Leaders:**

The first two redistricting cases, United States v. Florida (No. 92-767) and Wetherell v. de Grandy (No. 92-519), involve challenges to the legislature's plan for the state Senate and House of Representatives in Florida. The Justice Department is arguing that the court should have made a greater effort to accommodate minority interests before concluding that such an effort was doomed to failure.

The third redistricting case, Alabama v. Figures (No. 91-1992), involves a challenge to a plan for seven Congressional districts in Alabama. A group of black officials and voters had argued that a second majority-black district should have been created, but the Bush Administration refused to back their position, and the court upheld the lower court's action.

The fourth case, Stowe v. Davis (No. 92-910), involves a dispute over frozen embryos between a divorced couple. The woman who wants custody of the embryos argues that they are human beings and have a right to life, citing a 1988 White House statement by President Ronald Reagan.

Finally, the Court refused to hear an appeal from a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court that found unconstitutional the state's enforcement of consumer fraud regulations against sellers of kosher food.

**Nature of Protest:** Complaint about slow progress in school desegregation, allegations of administrative failures, and calls for more funding to address the issue.

**Key Concerns:**

1. **Vestiges of racism**: The protest claims that vestiges of racial discrimination remain in the schools, which could lead to a finding of liability against the state.
2. **Administrative failures**: Critics argue that Dr. Batista's leadership has contributed to the lack of progress in desegregation efforts.
3. **Lack of resources**: Some officials contend that insufficient funding is hindering the integration process.

**Parties Involved:**

1. **Yonkers School District**: Filed a complaint against the State Department of Education, State Education Commissioner, Dr. Thomas Sobel, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
2. **National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)**: Joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff.

Through a series of activities, including visits to a federal courtroom and a jail, watching ""Schindler's List,"" and therapy sessions, the participants were encouraged to confront their hatred and consider alternative values.

Another participant expressed a desire to abandon her hatred and pay taxes in church. Many of the youths found the sessions with Holocaust survivors particularly powerful, as they were challenged to consider the consequences of their actions.

The article also notes that not all participants were equally affected by the experience. Two members of the group, Mr. Boese and Mr. Fisher, remained distant from the others and seemed more resistant to change.

9407020,699033,"A historic and poignant case indeed! The University of Texas Law School's affirmative action policy is at the center of this controversy, with allegations of reverse discrimination against white students. The case, Hopwood v. University of Texas, has sparked a national debate on the merits and drawbacks of affirmative action.

The key issue revolves around the university's use of racial preferences in admissions, which critics argue disadvantages white applicants while favoring minority candidates. The plaintiffs, including white law school applicant Ms. Hopwood, claim that they were rejected due to their race, despite having similar qualifications to admitted minority students.

The case highlights the complexities and challenges of affirmative action. On one hand, proponents argue that it is a necessary tool to overcome historical discrimination and provide opportunities for underrepresented minorities. On the other hand, critics contend that racial preferences lead to reverse discrimination against white applicants, violating their constitutional rights.

The trial has yielded intriguing statistics, including the fact that virtually every black and Mexican-American student admitted to the law school received a scholarship, regardless of financial need. This raises questions about the effectiveness of affirmative action in promoting diversity and inclusion.

As the case moves forward, it will be essential for Judge Sparks to balance the competing interests at play. The outcome will have significant implications not only for the University of Texas Law School but also for institutions across the country grappling with similar issues.

In the words of Terral R. Smith, a lawyer for the plaintiffs: ""The university is not helping poor black people with affirmative action. It is denying people like Hopwood and giving special privileges to upper-middle-class black people and Mexican-Americans.""

Indeed, this case serves as a reminder that affirmative action is a complex issue, requiring careful consideration of the benefits and drawbacks. The question remains: What price are we willing to pay for diversity and inclusion in higher education?",

**Racial tensions**: The article highlights deep-seated racial tensions in Cobb County, with many white residents expressing resistance to integration and change. Some even advocate for segregation, citing concerns about crime and poverty.

**Segregationist sentiment**: Former Cobb Commissioner Emmett Burton is quoted as saying he would ""stock the Chattahoochee with piranha"" to keep rapid transit out of the county. This reflects a broader attitude among some white residents who want to maintain racial segregation.

**Integration and assimilation**: The article quotes Newt Gingrich, then a Republican strategist, who suggests that integration and assimilation are not necessarily the goals for many black residents in Cobb County. Instead, they simply want to be ""Americans, integrated, assimilated, living in neighborhoods that are safe.""

**Housing discrimination**: The article notes that many black residents face housing discrimination in Cobb County, with two-thirds of applicants receiving different information and treatment than white applicants.

**Extremist groups**: The article highlights the presence of extremist groups in Cobb County, including white supremacists and anti-Semites. These groups disseminate hate literature and engage in harassment.

**Christian right**: The article notes that the homosexual resolution was largely driven by groups at the fringe of the Christian right. This has led to a backlash against the county's reputation as intolerant.

**Conservative politics**: Cobb County is characterized as having conservative politics, reflecting its demographics and cultural values. However, this conservatism is not necessarily seen as extreme or bigoted by many residents.

**Protest Location:** Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park

**Protest Issue:** The reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) in Yellowstone National Park, which has been debated for years due to concerns about land use, livestock, and conservation.

**Protest Groups:**

1. **Wolf supporters**: Environmentalists, scientists, and wildlife advocates who believe the reintroduction of wolves will restore balance to Yellowstone's ecosystem and boost local tourism.
2. **Ranchers and livestock owners**: Opponents who fear that wolf reintroduction will lead to increased attacks on their livestock, causing financial losses and emotional distress.

**Protest Arguments:**

Wolf supporters:

1. Wolves would thin the elk population by 5-20%, restoring balance to Yellowstone's ecosystem.
2. Wolf reintroduction would generate an additional $19 million in tourism dollars annually.
3. Wolves are essential to preserving Yellowstone's natural heritage.

Ranchers and livestock owners:

1. Reintroducing wolves would put their livelihoods at risk, causing financial losses and emotional distress.
2. The provision of a $100,000 fund for compensating ranchers is insufficient to cover potential losses.
3. Wolf reintroduction would lead to increased conflict between humans and wildlife, compromising public safety.

**Protest Actions:**

1. **Legal challenges**: Ranchers have filed lawsuits against the wolf reintroduction plan, seeking to halt or modify it.
2. **Public education**: Environmentalists and scientists are working to educate the public about the benefits of wolf reintroduction and the importance of preserving Yellowstone's ecosystem.
3. **Community engagement**: Local residents are being encouraged to participate in discussions about the wolf reintroduction plan and its potential impacts on their communities.

* The NRDC has been working to force transportation agencies around the country to recognize their role in polluting waterways and take steps to stop it.

9412132,733750,"The article highlights the struggles of low-income tenants facing eviction due to back rent owed, often without legal representation or access to emergency funds. The situation is exacerbated by the complexity of the court system and the lack of resources available to tenants.

One example given is Jean Rich, a 66-year-old woman who has lived in her apartment for 17 years but fell behind on rent after being hospitalized. She received a 72-hour eviction notice and was uncertain about what legal defenses she could claim or which agencies could provide emergency funds.

The article also mentions the role of lawyers in the court system, with some landlords' lawyers using aggressive tactics to pressure tenants into signing stipulations (agreements) that may not be in their best interests. The article suggests that providing lawyers to tenants at an earlier stage, such as when they receive a dispossess notice, could help prevent evictions and protect tenant rights.

The article also highlights the challenges faced by housing court judges, who are responsible for mediating disputes between landlords and tenants. Judges must balance the needs of both parties while also ensuring that the court's purpose is served, which is to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving disputes.

Some quotes from the article include:

* ""I don't know what line to stand in, what legal defenses I could claim, or which agencies could provide emergency funds."" - Jean Rich
* ""Everything about this system is designed to frustrate the landlord in his collection of rent."" - Kenneth Mintz, a landlords' lawyer
* ""For poor people, starting a case to get repairs is a luxury. Unless the roof is caving in, peeling paint does not seem important -- which is sad when you think about lead paint."" - Rolando T. Acosta, chief of the Legal Aid Society's Brooklyn civil division

Overall, the article suggests that providing legal representation and resources to low-income tenants could help prevent evictions and protect their rights.",

2. The waste is treated sewage sludge, which was previously stored on Manhattan's streets.
3. The company applied for a beneficial-use registration with the Texas Water Commission instead of a dumping permit, which allowed them to bypass public hearings.
4. Merco hired Susan E. Potts, an Austin lawyer, who brought in Cliff Johnson, a former Water Commission board member and aide to Governor George W. Bush Jr. to expedite their application.
5. The Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences was paid $1.5 million to study the project and found that the sludge increased grass growth and decreased erosion with no buildup of heavy metals.
6. Residents in Sierra Blanca, where the waste is being disposed of, are opposed to the project, citing concerns about the smell, health risks, and environmental impact.
7. The Hudspeth County Commission sued to stop the project, but Merco filed a countersuit, which prompted the commission to back down.
8. The EPA has been involved in the case, with Assistant to the Director Hugh B. Kaufman pushing for an investigation into the agency's handling of the matter.

Officer Grant, a black officer, expresses his frustration with the department's leadership and the lack of support for addressing these issues. He cites examples of racist behavior by white officers and their resistance to Chief Williams' efforts to reform the department.

Officer Grant criticizes Chief Williams, saying he is ""just window-dressing"" and not a problem solver. He also mentions that some white officers had vowed to resist Williams' leadership before his appointment. Grant notes that even after Williams took office, those same officers continued to frustrate him by refusing to display his picture in the jail.

The article also quotes Ronnie Catto, vice president of the Bryant Foundation, who says racism is ""embedded"" in the department and compares it to a cancer. He shares an anecdote about a white female officer who made a derogatory comment about a black male partner's hair comb, which he considers a form of racism.

Deputy Chief Bernard Parks is also quoted, saying that the department is being ""victimized by a stereotype"" that there is a large racist element within it. He notes that discipline is an issue that cannot be publicly disclosed, making it difficult to demonstrate accountability for wrongdoing.

Officer Grant and other black officers express their disappointment with the lack of progress in addressing corruption and bigotry within the department. They believe that the Christopher Commission's recommendations were not fully implemented, and that senior officers who worked with former Detective Mark Fuhrman knew about his racist behavior but turned a blind eye.

The regional office of the National Labor Relations Board has issued an unfair-labor-practice complaint against the companies, stating that they have not bargained in good faith. If the unions ultimately win this case, the companies could be forced to take the strikers back if they offered to return.

The strike is expected to continue for a long time, causing significant damage to the newspapers' circulation numbers and revenue. The newspapers have lost 24 percent of their combined daily circulation, and some advertisers have boycotted them. The unions are planning to start their own weekly Sunday paper to try to lure advertisers and readers away from the companies.

The strike has caused a lot of human toll, with teamsters and pressmen unsure if they will ever work in the industry again. Old friendships have been broken, careers have been derailed, and families have been uprooted as people leave town for new jobs. The strike has also affected the morale of the journalists who are not crossing the picket lines, with some feeling that their colleagues who did cross the line are ""in it for themselves"" and do not understand why it is important for union people to stick together.

Despite the challenges, the unions remain determined to fight on and prove that they cannot be crushed. The national president of the Newspaper Guild has said that the companies want to bust the unions, and it's up to the guild to prove that they can't do that.",

* Problem: Colleges struggle to determine how much each parent should pay for their child's education after divorce.
* Cause: Lack of guidance from courts on parental financial responsibilities.
* Effect:
	+ Private colleges and universities expect both parents to contribute financially, even if the noncustodial parent is not involved in the child's life.
	+ Public universities are less insistent that both parents contribute, with some institutions only requiring information about the custodial parent's income.
	+ Divorced parents who have been estranged from their children are less likely to help with college bills.
