40,40,9507014,775140,"This article reports on the controversy surrounding the dumping of New York City's sewage sludge in Sierra Blanca, a small town in western Texas. The sludge is being spread on a large ranch as fertilizer, but many residents and environmentalists are concerned about the potential health and environmental risks.

Here are the main points from the article:

1. **Merco's operation**: Merco, a company based in New York, has been shipping its sewage sludge to Sierra Blanca since 1992. The sludge is spread on a 15,000-acre ranch as fertilizer.
2. **Concerns about health risks**: Many residents of Sierra Blanca are concerned that the sludge could contaminate their water supply and pose health risks. They point out that the sludge contains heavy metals, bacteria, and other pollutants.
3. **EPA whistleblower**: Hugh Kaufman, an assistant to the director of the EPA's Hazardous Site Control Division, has spoken out against the dumping of sludge in Sierra Blanca. He claims that the EPA has mishandled the case and has asked for a special prosecutor to investigate.
4. **Mafia connections**: There are allegations that two Merco partners paid tens of thousands of dollars to the Lucchese crime family in Brooklyn. Merco denies any wrongdoing, but the allegations have raised concerns about the company's ethics.
5. **Support from local officials**: Some local officials, including the county commissioner, support the sludge dumping operation. They argue that it brings much-needed jobs and revenue to the area.
6. **Environmental experts divided**: Experts are divided on the safety of using sludge as fertilizer. Some argue that it can improve soil quality, while others claim that it poses significant environmental risks.
7. **Economic benefits**: The sludge dumping operation has brought significant economic benefits to the area. Merco's annual revenues from its contract are close to Hudspeth County's total personal income.

Overall, the article highlights the complex and contentious issue of sewage sludge disposal in Sierra Blanca. While some see it as a necessary evil that brings economic benefits, others are concerned about the potential health and environmental risks.

Some possible discussion questions based on this article:

1. What are the pros and cons of using sewage sludge as fertilizer?
2. Should economic benefits be prioritized over environmental concerns?
3. How can communities like Sierra Blanca balance their need for economic development with their responsibility to protect public health and the environment?
4. What role should government agencies, such as the EPA, play in regulating industries that pose potential environmental risks?",0

52,52,9511024,809090,"The article discusses the complexities of child support and college tuition payments in cases of divorce, particularly when one parent is estranged from their children. The case of Philip Kline, who adopted his two stepchildren and had a biological daughter with his ex-wife, Bonita Curtis, is highlighted.

After separating from his wife in 1984, Mr. Kline lost contact with his children for eight years due to a combination of his own anger and his ex-wife's discouragement. When his son Jason reached college age, Mr. Kline tried to modify the $850-a-month support order, which was reduced but still required him to pay $375 per month for each daughter.

The issue came to a head when Amber finished high school and Mr. Kline was ordered to pay her college tuition. He took his case to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, arguing that he should not be forced to pay for Amber's education since he had been estranged from her for so long.

However, during a hearing, Amber burst into tears on the witness stand, describing her troubled relationship with her father. This moment marked a turning point for Mr. Kline, who decided to reconcile with his children and take responsibility for their well-being.

The article also explores how colleges and universities handle financial aid for students from divorced families. Private institutions like Stanford and Columbia often require both parents to contribute to the student's education, while public universities like the University of California at Berkeley only expect the custodial parent to contribute.

The Federal Government's standard for determining financial aid is also relatively loose, allowing even wealthy individuals like Donald Trump to qualify for some forms of aid. College administrators note that divorced parents are less likely to help with college bills if they have been estranged from their children.

Ultimately, Mr. Kline's relationship with his children has improved significantly since he reconciled with them. He is now paying Amber's tuition at Kutztown University and has helped her buy a car. He also plans to support his younger daughter Rebecca's college education and would help his son Jason if he were to attend graduate school.

The article highlights the complexities and nuances of family relationships, particularly in cases of divorce and estrangement. It also underscores the importance of parents taking responsibility for their children's well-being, even if they are no longer together.",0

72,72,9512004,812718,"The article discusses several cases where individuals have been wrongly convicted or are at risk of being wrongly executed due to flawed evidence, inadequate legal representation, or other issues. Here are some key points from the article:

1. **Paris Carriger's case**: Carriger was convicted of murder in 1978 based on the testimony of Robert Dunbar, who later confessed to the crime and implicated himself as the perpetrator. Despite this, Carriger's execution was scheduled until a stay was granted by the US Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit.
2. **Flawed evidence and testimony**: The article highlights several issues with the prosecution's case against Carriger, including:
	* Dunbar's history of violence and dishonesty, which was not disclosed to the jury.
	* The lack of physical evidence linking Carriger to the crime.
	* Inadequate cross-examination of Dunbar by Carriger's defense attorney.
3. **Ineffective assistance of counsel**: Carriger's original defense attorney, Thurman Gay, had limited experience with criminal law and devoted only 11 hours to the case before trial. This led to several critical mistakes, including failing to cross-examine Dunbar and not allowing Carriger to take the stand in his own defense.
4. **Recanted confessions**: The article notes that Dunbar recanted his confession to the crime on multiple occasions, which raises questions about the reliability of his testimony.
5. **Broader issues with the justice system**: The article touches on several broader issues with the US justice system, including:
	* The risk of wrongful convictions and executions due to flawed evidence or inadequate legal representation.
	* The need for more stringent standards for evaluating evidence and witness testimony.
	* The importance of ensuring that defendants receive effective assistance of counsel.

Some potential discussion questions based on this article could include:

1. What are some potential flaws in the US justice system that can lead to wrongful convictions?
2. How can we improve the reliability of eyewitness testimony and confession evidence?
3. What role should defense attorneys play in ensuring that their clients receive a fair trial, and how can we hold them accountable for inadequate representation?
4. Should there be more stringent standards for evaluating evidence and witness testimony in capital cases?
5. How can we balance the need to punish criminals with the need to protect the rights of defendants and prevent wrongful convictions?",0

156,156,9502018,742611,"This article tells the story of Alfonzo Tatum, an African American man who faced racial harassment and discrimination at his workplace, Cooper Power, in Milwaukee. He filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1992, but due to the commission's backlog and understaffing, his case took over two years to investigate.

During this time, Tatum suffered extreme work-related stress, which led to a major depressive disorder, according to his doctor. He was unable to work and had to rely on his wife's income to support their family. The delay in resolving his case caused significant financial hardship for the family, including losing their home and struggling to make ends meet.

Despite the challenges, Tatum persisted in pursuing his claim, and in January 1995, the EEOC finally found ""reasonable cause"" to believe that Cooper Power had violated Tatum's civil rights. The commission invited Tatum and Cooper Power to negotiate a settlement, which could include compensatory and punitive damages.

The article highlights the difficulties faced by individuals who file complaints with the EEOC, including long delays and inadequate staffing. It also underscores the importance of perseverance and the need for greater support for those who experience workplace discrimination.

Some key points from the article include:

1. **Delays in the EEOC process**: Tatum's case took over two years to investigate, during which time he suffered significant financial hardship.
2. **Understaffing at the EEOC**: The Milwaukee district office, where Tatum's case was filed, carried one of the heaviest loads of the 50 commission offices nationwide, with each investigator handling an average of 143 cases.
3. **Impact on mental health**: Tatum's experience of racial harassment and the subsequent delay in resolving his case took a significant toll on his mental health, leading to a major depressive disorder.
4. **Financial hardship**: The delay in resolving Tatum's case caused significant financial hardship for his family, including losing their home and struggling to make ends meet.
5. **Importance of perseverance**: Despite the challenges, Tatum persisted in pursuing his claim, and eventually, the EEOC found ""reasonable cause"" to believe that Cooper Power had violated his civil rights.

Overall, the article highlights the need for greater support and resources for individuals who experience workplace discrimination and the importance of addressing the systemic issues that contribute to delays and inadequate investigations.",0

164,164,9503009,746702,"The article tells the story of Iris Pyne, a woman who shot and killed her husband, Richard Pyne, in 1993. The incident occurred after a long history of domestic abuse, with Mrs. Pyne claiming that her husband had been physically and emotionally abusive to her throughout their marriage.

According to Mrs. Pyne's account, the abuse began early in their relationship, with Mr. Pyne knocking her unconscious during an argument just two months after they started living together. Despite this, Mrs. Pyne stayed in the relationship, hoping that her husband would change. However, the abuse continued, with Mr. Pyne punching her, forcing her to have sex, and threatening her with a knife.

In the years leading up to the shooting, Mrs. Pyne had obtained several orders of protection against her husband, but she never followed through with divorce proceedings. She claimed that her husband would apologize and promise to change after each incident, and she wanted to believe that he could overcome his abusive behavior.

On the day of the shooting, Mrs. Pyne discovered that her husband was having an affair with another woman. The two got into an argument, during which Mr. Pyne grabbed a knife and threatened her. Mrs. Pyne claimed that she shot her husband in self-defense, using a licensed revolver that he had bought for her.

The prosecution argued that Mrs. Pyne's use of deadly force was not justified, as she could have retreated to safety instead of shooting her husband. The central prosecution witness, Dr. Michael Baden, testified that the first bullet had paralyzed Mr. Pyne, and the subsequent shots were unnecessary.

Mrs. Pyne's lawyer, Mr. Tendy, argued that his client had acted in self-defense, and that the prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence. However, the jury ultimately found Mrs. Pyne guilty of murder.

The article raises questions about the complexities of domestic abuse and the challenges faced by women who are trapped in abusive relationships. It also highlights the difficulties of proving self-defense in cases where the victim is killed, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the circumstances surrounding such incidents.

Some possible discussion points based on this article could include:

1. The complexities of domestic abuse: How can we better understand and address the root causes of domestic abuse, and what support systems can be put in place to help women who are trapped in abusive relationships?
2. Self-defense laws: Should self-defense laws be reformed to take into account the complexities of domestic abuse, and to provide more protection for women who are forced to defend themselves against their abusers?
3. The role of societal expectations: How do societal expectations around marriage, family, and relationships contribute to the perpetuation of domestic abuse, and what can be done to challenge these expectations and promote healthier relationships?
4. The impact of trauma: How can we better support women who have experienced trauma and abuse, and what resources can be provided to help them heal and rebuild their lives?",0

258,258,9306028,618365,"The article discusses the complex and often contentious relationship between the African American community and the LGBTQ+ community, particularly in the context of the civil rights movement. Many African Americans feel that the comparison between racism and homophobia is invalid, and that the LGBTQ+ community is co-opting the legacy of the civil rights movement. Some argue that the struggles faced by LGBTQ+ individuals are not equivalent to those faced by African Americans, and that the two communities have different experiences and histories.

However, others, including prominent African American leaders like Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King, argue that discrimination is discrimination, regardless of whether it is based on race, sexuality, or other factors. They believe that the LGBTQ+ community's fight for equal rights is a natural extension of the civil rights movement, and that all forms of bigotry and prejudice should be opposed.

The article also highlights the experiences of black homosexuals, who often face racism within the LGBTQ+ community and homophobia within their own communities. Many black homosexuals feel that they are caught between two worlds, and that they are not fully accepted by either the African American community or the LGBTQ+ community.

Despite these challenges, many African Americans support guarantees of equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and see the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights as part of a broader fight against discrimination and oppression. As one advocate notes, ""Those who hate blacks hate gay people, hate Jews and abuse women, and fighting on behalf of any of us will ultimately lead to the liberation of all of us.""

Some key points from the article include:

* Many African Americans feel that the comparison between racism and homophobia is invalid, and that the LGBTQ+ community is co-opting the legacy of the civil rights movement.
* Prominent African American leaders like Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King support the LGBTQ+ community's fight for equal rights, and see it as a natural extension of the civil rights movement.
* Black homosexuals often face racism within the LGBTQ+ community and homophobia within their own communities, and feel caught between two worlds.
* Many African Americans support guarantees of equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, and see the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights as part of a broader fight against discrimination and oppression.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities and challenges of building alliances between different marginalized communities, and the need for greater understanding and empathy in the pursuit of social justice.",0

270,270,9308006,625482,"This article discusses the ongoing desegregation case in Yonkers, New York, which was initially filed in 1980 by the US Justice Department. The current court action is a continuation of this case, with the Board of Education and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) suing the State Department of Education, the State Education Commissioner, and Governor Mario Cuomo.

The lawsuit claims that the state contributed to the problem of racial segregation in Yonkers through certain actions and failures to take action. The plaintiffs are seeking funds to address the remaining vestiges of racism in the schools, including rebuilding and renovating school buildings, training programs for guidance counselors and teachers, revising the curriculum, and reducing class size.

The article highlights the complexities of the case, with different parties having varying opinions on the causes of the lack of progress in integrating the schools. Some attribute it to outside forces, such as the state's elimination of a fund to help school districts achieve racial balance, while others blame administrative failures within the system.

Key points from the article include:

1. **Vestiges of racism remain**: The lawsuit claims that despite efforts to desegregate the schools, vestiges of racism still exist in the Yonkers school system.
2. **State liable**: The plaintiffs argue that the state is liable for contributing to the problem of racial segregation in Yonkers and should share the costs of remedying it.
3. **Funding needed**: The Board of Education is seeking funds to address the remaining issues, including $311 million to rebuild and renovate school buildings.
4. **Administrative failures**: Some board members attribute the lack of progress to administrative failures within the system, including giving the Superintendent too much autonomy.
5. **Demographic changes**: The shift in demographics in Yonkers, with an increasing Hispanic population and some white families moving out, is also a factor in the changing student body composition.

The outcome of the case will determine whether the state is liable for contributing to the problem of racial segregation in Yonkers and how much it must pay to help remedy the issue. The judge's decision will have significant implications for the future of education in Yonkers and potentially other cities facing similar desegregation challenges.",0

310,310,9410022,720121,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding street vendors on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City. The vendors, who have been operating on the street for years, were recently relocated by the city as part of an effort to clean up and revitalize the area. However, many in the community are divided over the issue, with some seeing the vendors as a nuisance and others viewing them as a vital part of the neighborhood's culture and economy.

The article notes that the number of vendors on 125th Street had grown significantly over the years, from around 100 to over 1,000, with many coming from West African countries. While some business owners and residents complained about the vendors, citing issues such as competition, trash, and difficulty getting deliveries into their stores, others saw them as a draw for tourists and shoppers.

The city's decision to relocate the vendors was met with resistance from some in the community, including the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7, which has been supporting the vendors. However, other groups, such as the Community Board 10 and the 125th Street Business Improvement District, have supported the relocation effort.

The article also highlights the complex relationships between the vendors, store owners, and development organizations in the area. Some store owners had been storing goods and equipment for vendors, while others had been selling their own goods on vending tables. Additionally, some development organizations, such as the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, have been pushing for the removal of the vendors.

Overall, the article suggests that the controversy surrounding the street vendors on 125th Street is a complex issue with no easy solutions. While some see the vendors as a problem to be solved, others view them as an integral part of the neighborhood's identity and economy.

Key points:

* The city relocated over 1,000 street vendors from 125th Street in Harlem as part of an effort to clean up and revitalize the area.
* The move was met with resistance from some in the community, including the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7.
* Some business owners and residents complained about the vendors, citing issues such as competition, trash, and difficulty getting deliveries into their stores.
* Others saw the vendors as a draw for tourists and shoppers, and an integral part of the neighborhood's culture and economy.

Possible discussion questions:

* What are the pros and cons of allowing street vendors to operate on 125th Street?
* How do the vendors contribute to or detract from the neighborhood's culture and economy?
* What role should development organizations play in shaping the character of the neighborhood?
* How can the city balance the needs and concerns of different stakeholders in the community?",0

396,396,8701002,200,"The article discusses a meeting between New York City Mayor Koch and a group of black community leaders to address the racial tensions in the city following the Howard Beach incident. The meeting was called to devise ways to ease these tensions and improve the city's racial climate. 

Some of the key points discussed during the meeting include:

1. **Criticism of the Mayor's evaluation of the case**: Some participants felt that the Mayor's criticism of Mr. Maddox, the lawyer for the victim's family, had caused problems by shifting the focus away from the racial attack itself.
2. **Need for education and enforcement of antidiscrimination laws**: The group emphasized the need to do more in the city's education system and enforce antidiscrimination laws in areas such as housing, employment, and other areas to improve the racial climate.
3. **Housing problems**: Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins highlighted the issues of poor housing, poverty, and other problems that plague blacks in the city, contributing to a climate that permits incidents like Howard Beach.
4. **New curriculum on race relations and tolerance**: The Schools Chancellor and the Board of Education president presented a new curriculum on race relations and tolerance to be instituted in city schools.

The meeting was seen as a positive step by some participants, with Representative Charles Rangel noting that the Mayor's response to the incident was more positive than in the past. However, not all issues were resolved, and some criticisms, such as the use of a racial slur by Reverend Al Sharpton, were not addressed.

Overall, the meeting represented an effort by the Mayor and community leaders to address the underlying issues contributing to racial tensions in the city and work towards creating a more positive and inclusive environment.",0

432,432,8703001,17909,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the use of salt on roads in Westchester County, New York, particularly in the town of Bedford. While some residents and officials are concerned about the environmental impact of salt on vegetation and drinking water, others argue that it is necessary for safety reasons.

Here are the main points from the article:

1. **Salt usage**: The use of salt on roads has been increasing over the years, with some towns using more salt than ever before.
2. **Environmental concerns**: Residents and officials are worried about the impact of salt on vegetation, drinking water, and the environment in general.
3. **Safety concerns**: Highway superintendents argue that reducing salt use would lead to more accidents, as commuters expect to drive at high speeds even in winter conditions.
4. **Lack of standards**: There are no formal standards for salt usage, and the county's guidelines are voluntary.
5. **Impact on drinking water**: Salt can contaminate drinking water, particularly in shallow wells near roads. However, the levels of sodium and chloride in affected wells are generally within safe limits.
6. **Alternatives**: Some towns are exploring alternative methods, such as using liquid calcium to reduce salt usage.
7. **Storage improvements**: Most towns have improved their salt storage facilities, which should help reduce environmental impact.
8. **Studies underway**: The county is studying ways to reduce or eliminate salt use on certain roads, particularly in rural areas.

Overall, the article highlights the complex trade-offs between safety, environmental concerns, and the need for effective road maintenance during winter months.",0
433,433,8703002,17909,"The article discusses the controversy over the use of salt on roads in Westchester County, New York, during winter months. While some residents and officials are concerned about the environmental impact of salt on vegetation and drinking water, others argue that it is necessary to ensure safe roads for commuters.

Here are the main points from the article:

1. **Salt usage increasing**: Despite efforts to reduce salt use, the total amount of salt used on Westchester County roads has increased due to growing commuter traffic.
2. **Environmental concerns**: Salt can harm vegetation and contaminate drinking water sources, particularly shallow wells near roads.
3. **Health risks**: High sodium levels in drinking water can be a concern for people with salt-restricted diets, although there are no formal standards for safe sodium levels in drinking water.
4. **Alternative solutions**: Studies are underway to reduce or eliminate salt use on certain roads, such as dirt roads in rural areas, and the use of liquid calcium may help make salt more efficient.
5. **Storage improvements**: Many towns have improved their salt storage facilities, which can help reduce environmental contamination.

Key quotes from the article:

* ""It's like butting your head against a wall"" - Frank B. McKown, president of the Bedford Association, on trying to change the State Department of Transportation's road-salting practices.
* ""Commuters are not thinking of the environment; they are thinking of getting home or to work"" - Edward F. Kelly, president of the Westchester Highway Supervisors Association, on why salt use is necessary for safe roads.
* ""For every person who says we are using too much salt, there is someone who says we are not using enough"" - Edward J. Kearin, Highway Superintendent of Lewisboro, on the conflicting opinions about salt use.

Overall, the article highlights the complex trade-offs between road safety and environmental protection, and the need for continued research and innovation to find more sustainable solutions for winter road maintenance.",0

460,460,8704015,28943,"This article from 1988 describes the racial tensions and power imbalance between the black and Hasidic Jewish communities in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The main issues highlighted are:

1. **Lack of representation**: Despite making up 78% of the population, blacks feel underrepresented on community boards and have limited access to resources.
2. **Security patrol controversy**: A predominantly white security patrol is seen as a ""vigilante"" squad that targets black residents, exacerbating tensions between the communities.
3. **Unequal distribution of development grants**: The Community Development Agency's grant allocation favors white organizations, with 33% of funds going to whites (who make up only 9.3% of the population) and 60% going to blacks.
4. **Perceived apartheid**: Many blacks feel that the neighborhood is administered by whites, with little regard for their needs or concerns.

The article cites various community leaders, including Rabbi Rosenfeld, Father Sam, and Representative Owens, who acknowledge the problems but offer different perspectives on how to address them. While some leaders are working to improve relations between the communities, others express frustration and pessimism about the prospects for change.

Some key statistics mentioned in the article include:

* 78% of Crown Heights residents are black
* 9.3% of residents are white (mostly Hasidic Jewish)
* 4.5% of grants went to Asian organizations (who make up 1.2% of the population)
* 2.2% of grants went to Hispanic organizations (who make up 9.5% of the population)

Overall, the article highlights the deep-seated tensions and inequalities in Crown Heights, which would eventually boil over into violent clashes between the black and Hasidic communities in 1991.",0

611,611,8711039,95887,"This article appears to be describing two separate prison uprisings involving Cuban inmates in the United States. Here's a summary of the events:

**Atlanta Prison Uprising**

* The uprising occurred at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, which houses 1,900 inmates, including 1,392 Cubans.
* The riot began just before lunchtime, with inmates setting fire to a prison factory and other buildings.
* National Guardsmen, FBI agents, and city and state police officers surrounded the prison, but were unable to enter due to the danger posed by the rioting inmates.
* Some Cuban prisoners returned voluntarily to their cells, while others continued to riot.
* The prison has a history of problems, including a previous riot in 1984, and has been considered one of the worst in the federal prison system.

**Oakdale Detention Facility Uprising**

* The uprising occurred at the Oakdale detention facility in Louisiana, which is housing Cuban refugees awaiting deportation.
* Inmates, armed with knives, pipes, and other makeshift weapons, took hostages, including guards and staff members.
* Negotiations between federal officials and inmates were ongoing, but no progress was reported.
* About 30 inmates and guards sustained minor injuries over the weekend, but there were no reports of further injuries.
* A team of federal negotiators, along with 300 law enforcement officials and 350 detention center staff members, were on the scene, surrounding the facility.

**Common Themes**

* Both uprisings involved Cuban inmates who are being held in the United States while awaiting deportation or serving sentences.
* The inmates appear to be motivated by a desire to avoid being returned to Cuba, with some reporting that they would rather die than be deported.
* The conditions at both facilities have been criticized, with the Atlanta prison being considered one of the worst in the federal system and the Oakdale facility being described as a ""concentration camp"" by one spectator.

Overall, these uprisings highlight the tensions and challenges faced by Cuban refugees and inmates in the United States, as well as the need for improved conditions and treatment at detention facilities.",0

731,731,8806009,151963,"This article appears to be a news report from 1988 about the Tawana Brawley case, in which a 15-year-old African American girl alleged that she had been kidnapped and raped by several white men, including police officers and a prosecutor. The case sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many in the African American community believing that the criminal justice system was biased against them.

In this specific article, Tawana Brawley's lawyers, Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, are refusing to cooperate with a grand jury investigation into the allegations, citing concerns about racism and bias in the justice system. The judge, Justice Nicholas Ingrassia, is attempting to persuade Maddox to allow Brawley to testify before the grand jury, but Maddox is resistant, stating that ""400 years of oppression"" are at play in the case.

The article suggests that Maddox and Mason may be trying to create a martyr out of Brawley by defying the court's orders, which could lead to her being held in contempt. The New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, is critical of Maddox and Mason's strategy, stating that they are providing ""reprehensible and irresponsible"" advice to their client.

The article also describes a chaotic scene outside the courthouse, where supporters of the Brawley family gather to protest and march through the streets. The atmosphere is tense, with dozens of state troopers on hand in case of violence.

Overall, the article provides a snapshot of the intense emotions and tensions surrounding the Tawana Brawley case, which became a symbol of the deep-seated racial divisions and mistrust of the justice system that existed in the United States at the time.",0

760,760,8808041,173386,"This article discusses the challenges faced by parents who adopt children with severe emotional and behavioral problems, often resulting from childhood trauma and abuse. The parents featured in the article have adopted children who exhibit extreme behaviors, such as violence, self-mutilation, and inappropriate sexual behavior, which are often associated with a condition known as ""unattached child syndrome.""

The article highlights several key issues:

1. **Lack of disclosure**: Many adoptive parents claim that they were not fully informed about their child's past trauma and abuse, making it difficult for them to provide adequate care and support.
2. **Inadequate support**: Parents feel that they are not receiving sufficient help from social services, insurance companies, or the government to address their child's complex needs.
3. **Emotional toll**: The adoptive parents are often overwhelmed by the demands of caring for a child with severe emotional and behavioral problems, which can lead to burnout and even relinquishment of custody.
4. **Financial burden**: The cost of providing specialized care and therapy for these children can be prohibitively expensive, and insurance coverage is often inadequate.

The article also mentions that some experts believe that the symptoms of unattached child syndrome worsen as the child approaches puberty. Additionally, it highlights the importance of education and training for social workers to recognize the long-term effects of childhood trauma and abuse.

Some specific examples from the article include:

* A 9-year-old girl who exhibits violent behavior, such as grabbing people's genitals, and has a history of being severely abused.
* A boy who was adopted at age 4 and later revealed to have been subjected to extreme physical abuse, including having his finger bitten off by his father.
* A set of twins who were adopted at age 4 and exhibited severe emotional problems, including ripping wallpaper off walls and sitting stone still for hours.

Overall, the article sheds light on the complex challenges faced by adoptive parents of children with severe emotional and behavioral problems and highlights the need for greater support, education, and resources to help these families cope.",0

871,871,8901074,216581,"The article discusses a proposed redevelopment plan for the downtown area of Hempstead, New York. The plan, backed by local businessman James Johansen and supported by some politicians, aims to revitalize the area with new businesses and housing. However, the plan has been met with opposition from some residents, merchants, and politicians, who are concerned about the potential loss of tax revenue, displacement of existing businesses, and lack of transparency in the planning process.

The article highlights the complex web of interests and alliances involved in the redevelopment plan. Assemblywoman Erlene Hill, who was initially supportive of the plan, later put a ""freeze"" on funding for a feasibility study after being approached by opponents of the plan. The Village Board of Trustees also failed to pass a resolution supporting the plan.

The article quotes various stakeholders, including Johansen, who claims to have secured a tenant for the first building in the proposed redevelopment area, and PUSH (People United for a Safe Hempstead) members, who are concerned about the impact of the plan on existing businesses and residents. The Urban Development Corporation is currently investigating the merits of the arguments for and against the plan.

The delays in the project have sparked concerns that the village may have to offer more incentives to attract developers, which could potentially hurt the project. The article also raises questions about how the village would pay for the estimated $16 million cost of acquisition, demolition, and relocation, as federal and state funding appears to be scarce.

Key issues and concerns mentioned in the article include:

1. Potential loss of tax revenue: Opponents of the plan are concerned that replacing existing businesses with new ones could lead to a loss of tax revenue.
2. Displacement of existing businesses: Merchants and residents are worried about being displaced by the redevelopment plan.
3. Lack of transparency: Some stakeholders feel that the planning process has not been transparent, leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions about the proposal.
4. Funding: The village is facing challenges in securing funding for the project, with federal and state grants appearing scarce.
5. Political interference: The article suggests that political considerations have influenced the decision-making process, with some politicians supporting or opposing the plan based on their own interests.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities and challenges involved in urban redevelopment projects, where competing interests, limited funding, and concerns about transparency and accountability can create obstacles to progress.",0

979,979,8906041,261405,"The article discusses the evolution of the gay rights movement over the 20 years since the Stonewall uprising in 1969. While there have been significant advances in terms of anti-discrimination laws and court decisions, the movement has shifted its focus from the courts to the political system due to the rise of conservatism and the AIDS epidemic.

Some key points from the article include:

* Over 50 jurisdictions, including most major cities, have passed anti-discrimination statutes to protect gay people.
* Federal and state courts have generally supported homosexual plaintiffs in cases where their rights were challenged, but a 1986 Supreme Court decision upheld the constitutionality of Georgia's sodomy law, which has raised concerns among gay-rights advocates.
* 25 states still have sodomy laws on the books, although there is less momentum for repeal and fewer prosecutions.
* The Federal court system has become more conservative due to judges appointed during the Reagan administration, making it less likely to find in favor of homosexuals in discrimination cases.
* The focus of the gay-rights movement has shifted from the courts to the political system, with a greater emphasis on lobbying and organizing around issues like AIDS.
* The Human Rights Campaign Fund, a political action committee, has become a major player in gay politics, providing financial support to candidates who support gay rights.
* Gay activists have gained greater access to policy-makers and are now taken more seriously by politicians, who recognize the power of the gay vote and the financial contributions that come with it.

The article also features quotes from various individuals involved in the gay rights movement, including Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund; Professor John D'Emilio; Vic Basile, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund; Martin Algaze, a former aide to Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler; and Donna Lee, a 16-year-old student at the Harvey Milk School.

Overall, the article suggests that while there have been significant advances in the gay rights movement over the past 20 years, there is still much work to be done to achieve full equality and protection for gay people. The shift in focus from the courts to the political system reflects a recognition that legislative and policy changes are necessary to address the ongoing challenges faced by the gay community.",0

1005,1005,8907088,270505,"The article discusses a controversy in New Jersey over new regulations requiring buffer zones, known as transition areas, between wetlands and development projects. The regulations, aimed at protecting the environment, have been met with opposition from developers who claim that they are being unfairly forced to redesign their projects and incur significant costs.

The dispute centers on the interpretation of a ""grandfather clause"" in the legislation, which was intended to exempt projects that had already received preliminary approval from municipalities before the regulations took effect. However, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has ruled that even projects with preliminary approval must comply with the new regulations, unless they are also exempt from Army Corps of Engineers regulations.

Developers argue that this interpretation is unfair and will lead to expensive redesigns and potential lawsuits. They claim that the regulations are too vague and will have a negative impact on development in the state. Environmentalists, on the other hand, argue that the transition areas are necessary to protect the environment and prevent harm to wildlife habitats.

The article quotes several experts, including developers, environmentalists, and lawyers, who express differing opinions on the issue. Some predict that the controversy will lead to numerous lawsuits against the Department of Environmental Protection, while others see the regulations as a necessary step to protect the environment.

Key points from the article include:

* The new regulations require buffer zones between wetlands and development projects
* Developers claim that the ""grandfather clause"" is not being applied fairly
* The Department of Environmental Protection has ruled that projects with preliminary approval must still comply with the regulations, unless exempt from Army Corps of Engineers regulations
* Environmentalists argue that the transition areas are necessary to protect wildlife habitats and prevent harm to the environment
* Developers predict that the controversy will lead to numerous lawsuits and have a negative impact on development in the state.",0

1012,1012,8908006,272660,"The article discusses a new plan proposed by the New Jersey Department of Education to revise its special education system. The plan aims to move away from labeling students as ""handicapped"" and instead provide support services to students with mild learning problems through a resource committee. This committee would work with teachers, parents, and other educators to develop individualized plans for students who need extra help.

The proposal has been met with both praise and criticism. Some argue that the plan is a cost-saving measure that could result in a loss of federal aid, as the number of classified handicapped students would decrease. However, Dr. Osowski, the director of special education, argues that the current system stigmatizes students who are labeled as handicapped, even if they only have mild learning problems.

The plan has been piloted in several districts, and initial results suggest that it is working effectively. Students are receiving support services within regular classrooms, and teachers report that the new system has not stigmatized students. However, some critics argue that the plan may put additional strains on schools that are already financially stretched.

One of the concerns raised by critics is that the plan may impede students with serious learning disabilities from getting the help they need. Patricia Sokolow, executive director of the Monmouth County chapter of the Association for Children/Adults With Learning Disabilities, reports that she has received complaints from teachers who feel that the resource committee has hindered students with severe learning disabilities.

Dr. Osowski emphasizes that the pilot is only half-completed and that final recommendations will not be made until next year. He also notes that the plan requires approval from the State Board of Education and the legislature before it can be implemented statewide.

Overall, the article suggests that the proposed plan has both potential benefits and drawbacks. While it may provide more effective support services for students with mild learning problems, it also raises concerns about the impact on students with more severe disabilities and the financial strain on schools.",0

1041,1041,8909032,282861,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and its funding of artworks that some consider obscene or indecent. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, backed by conservative organizations, is attempting to introduce an amendment to restrict NEA funding, while Senator Jesse Helms is pushing a similar measure in the Senate.

The article highlights the intense lobbying efforts on both sides of the issue, with conservatives like Rohrabacher and Helms arguing that taxpayer money should not be used to fund art that they consider objectionable. On the other hand, supporters of the NEA, like Representative Sidney Yates, argue that such restrictions would cripple the agency and stifle artistic freedom.

The article notes that the controversy has become highly politicized, with both sides using tactics like press releases, letter-writing campaigns, and rallies to influence public opinion and pressure lawmakers. The issue is expected to come to a head when the House and Senate conferees meet to resolve their differences over the NEA's funding.

Some key points from the article include:

* Representative Rohrabacher has lined up support from 22 national conservative organizations to back his amendment to restrict NEA funding.
* Senator Helms has sent prints of controversial artworks, including those by Robert Mapplethorpe, to Senate conferees to dramatize his opposition to NEA funding.
* The controversy has sparked intense lobbying efforts on both sides, with fax machines and mailboxes overflowing with letters and petitions.
* Lawmakers who oppose the restrictions on NEA funding risk being targeted by conservative groups and facing backlash in their home districts.

Overall, the article suggests that the debate over NEA funding is a highly charged and politicized issue, with both sides dug in and refusing to compromise. The outcome is uncertain, but it is clear that the controversy will continue to be a major point of contention in the coming weeks and months.",0

1121,1121,8912041,309074,"The article discusses several incidents of radiation exposure at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s and 1960s, which resulted in workers receiving doses of radiation far exceeding safety limits. Some of the incidents mentioned include:

1. In 1955, a security guard named Eugene D. Haynes received a dose of at least 39 rems of radiation after wandering into a contaminated area near a nuclear test site. He later died of lung cancer in 1985.
2. In November 1955 and January 1956, at least four workers received high doses of radiation during experiments involving the destruction of atomic bombs using conventional explosives. One worker, Oral B. Epley, died of a brain hemorrhage in 1956, and another worker, Joe Carter, died of brain cancer in 1980.
3. In November 1961, 108 miners were pulled out of tunnels at the test site after radiation safety monitors detected high levels of radiation. The miners were given beer to drink to help flush out the contaminants from their bodies.
4. In June 1963, 13 miners were contaminated with radioactive iodine while working in a tunnel where an atomic test had been conducted the previous day. Despite knowing about the contamination, Atomic Energy Commission officials ordered miners on the next shift to continue working in the tunnel.

The article also mentions that radiation safety and training programs have improved significantly since the 1960s, and that there is no indication of a cancer epidemic at the Nevada Test Site. However, the Energy Department has never conducted a comprehensive survey of the health of workers at the test site, due in part to poor record-keeping in the 1950s and 1960s.

Some of the key points from the article include:

* Many workers at the Nevada Test Site received high doses of radiation in the 1950s and 1960s, often due to inadequate safety procedures or lack of training.
* Some workers died as a result of their exposure to radiation, including Eugene D. Haynes, Oral B. Epley, and Joe Carter.
* The Atomic Energy Commission and other government agencies were aware of the risks of radiation exposure but often prioritized the completion of nuclear tests over worker safety.
* Radiation safety and training programs have improved significantly since the 1960s, but there is still a need for better record-keeping and health monitoring of workers at the test site.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of prioritizing worker safety and taking steps to prevent radiation exposure in industries that involve nuclear testing or other hazardous activities.",0

1137,1137,9001035,314610,"This article discusses the rising costs of home heating oil in Westchester, New York, and how some residents are turning to fuel cooperatives as a way to save money. The cooperatives, such as the Fuel Buyers Group and Heating Energy Affordable Today, purchase oil in bulk and offer discounts to their members.

According to the article, many low-income people on public assistance are not affected by the rising costs of home heating oil because they live in buildings where heat is included in the rent payment. However, for homeowners like Ralph and Mary Joan Fiorio and Virginia and Arthur Francus, the escalating fuel costs are a significant burden.

The Fiorios, who own a 100-year-old home in Cortlandt, estimate that their house requires 30 gallons of home heating oil per day, and they have seen their price increase from $0.95 to $1.36 per gallon in just one month. The Francuses, who live in a 14-room Tudor home in New Rochelle, were paying $1.55 per gallon, which is 26 cents more than the week before.

The fuel cooperatives offer a way for homeowners to save money on their heating oil costs. For example, the Fuel Buyers Group offers discounts of up to 25 cents per gallon below the retail market price. The cooperatives purchase oil in bulk and then sell it to their members at a lower price, without dealer markups.

However, not everyone is convinced that fuel cooperatives are the answer. Critics warn that service can be erratic and that extra charges may be levied for service contracts on heating systems. Richard Goldberg, president of Heating Energy Affordable Today, counters that a recent survey showed that 94% of members were satisfied with the service provided by the cooperative.

County Legislator Paul J. Feiner believes that fuel cooperatives not only save customers money but also send a message to oil companies that customers are willing to shop around for better deals. He suggests that this could lead to major companies reducing their rates.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by homeowners in Westchester who are struggling with rising heating oil costs and explores the potential benefits of fuel cooperatives as a way to save money and gain more control over energy costs.

Some key points from the article include:

* Many low-income people on public assistance are not affected by rising home heating oil costs because they live in buildings where heat is included in the rent payment.
* Homeowners like Ralph and Mary Joan Fiorio and Virginia and Arthur Francus are struggling with escalating fuel costs, with prices increasing by as much as 26 cents per gallon in just one month.
* Fuel cooperatives like the Fuel Buyers Group and Heating Energy Affordable Today offer discounts of up to 25 cents per gallon below the retail market price.
* Critics warn that service can be erratic and extra charges may be levied for service contracts on heating systems, but cooperative representatives counter that their members are satisfied with the service provided.

1143,1143,9001039,315385,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear several new cases, including one related to affirmative action and another concerning the National Guard. The affirmative action case involves a challenge to a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policy that gives preference to minority-owned companies in the sale of broadcast licenses. The policy was enacted in 1978 to increase diversity in media ownership, but its impact has been limited.

The Court's decision to hear this case may have implications for other federal affirmative action programs. In 1989, the Court ruled in Richmond v. Croson that a similar program in Richmond, Virginia, was unconstitutional, and it is unclear whether the FCC's policy will be affected by this ruling.

In another case, the Court has agreed to decide whether the Federal Government has the constitutional authority to force Governors to permit the mobilization of state National Guard units to active duty overseas. This case, Perpich v. Dept. of Defense, involves a challenge to a 1986 federal law known as the Montgomery Amendment, which prohibits governors from withholding their consent for such mobilization.

The Court has also agreed to hear a case involving a labor union's duty to protect its members' safety on the job. In United Steelworkers v. Rawson, the Court will decide whether workers injured on the job may sue their labor unions for negligence in failing to carry out the safety provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.

Additionally, the Court has refused to hear an appeal by an FBI agent whose $25 million libel suit against author Peter Mattheissen was dismissed by a federal appeals court. The agent, David Price, had claimed that Mattheissen's book, ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse,"" defamed him, but the appeals court ruled that the statements in question were constitutionally protected as opinion or neutral reportage.

Overall, these cases reflect the Court's ongoing consideration of important issues related to affirmative action, federal power, labor law, and free speech.",0

1175,1175,9002017,325926,"This article reports on the controversy surrounding the ordination of Robert Williams, a gay man, as an Episcopal priest by Bishop John Spong. The ordination was met with protests from traditionalist groups and appeared to violate a 1979 resolution by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church stating that it was ""not appropriate"" to ordain homosexuals to the priesthood.

Bishop Spong maintained that the resolution was only advisory and that Williams had undergone a thorough screening process before being ordained. However, just weeks after his ordination, Williams gave a presentation in which he stated that monogamy was not essential for a valid Christian relationship and that celibacy was ""an inherently negative phenomenon."" These comments sparked outrage and led Bishop Spong to disassociate himself from Williams and order him to cease functioning as a priest.

Williams claimed that he had been open with Bishop Spong about his views on sexual matters from the start and that the Bishop was reacting to pressure from others. He believed that he had been ""used"" by Bishop Spong as a symbol of liberalism and that the Bishop was trying to distance himself from him due to criticism.

The controversy has sparked a wider debate within the Episcopal Church, with some calling for Bishop Spong to face a church trial on the national level. The incident has highlighted the deep divisions within the church on issues of sexuality and morality.

Key points:

* Robert Williams, a gay man, was ordained as an Episcopal priest by Bishop John Spong despite protests from traditionalist groups.

1209,1209,9003022,333629,"The article discusses the effectiveness and fairness of New Jersey's drunk driving laws, particularly with regards to the use of Breathalyzers and sobriety checkpoints. Some experts argue that the margin of error in Breathalyzer tests is too high, which could lead to false convictions. The article also mentions the controversy surrounding sobriety checkpoints, with some arguing that they are unconstitutional.

Here are the main points from the article:

1. **Breathalyzer accuracy**: Dr. Borkenstein, an expert on Breathalyzers, recommends that prosecutions should not occur below a reading of 0.11 to account for a 3% margin of error.
2. **Sobriety checkpoints**: The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that sobriety checkpoints are acceptable, but the American Civil Liberties Union argues that they are unconstitutional and violate individuals' rights.
3. **Effectiveness of laws**: While some experts argue that the laws have been effective in reducing drunk driving deaths, others believe that more needs to be done to address the issue.
4. **Penalties for drunk driving**: The article outlines the penalties for first-time, second-time, and third-time offenders, which include fines, license revocation, community service, and imprisonment.

Some of the key statistics mentioned in the article include:

* 49,000 people were arrested for drunk driving in New Jersey last year.
* Drunk driving deaths have decreased since enforcement efforts increased.
* The state's Division of Highway Traffic Safety reports that sobriety checkpoints are an effective deterrent against drunk driving.",0
1210,1210,9003019,333630,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the Federal Aviation Administration's (F.A.A.) changes to flight routes over New Jersey, which have resulted in increased noise pollution for many communities. The changes were made to accommodate growing air traffic, but residents claim that the noise is unbearable and has destroyed their quality of life.

Some key points from the article include:

* The F.A.A. changed flight routes in 1987, which shifted noise from one community to another, affecting areas such as Short Hills and Far Hills.
* Residents like Mary Jane Semcer have been forced to move due to the noise, only to find that it followed them to their new homes.
* The coalition of residents affected by the noise is not just comprised of affluent communities, but also includes people living close to the airport who have been experiencing noise for years.
* The F.A.A. claims that it must balance environmental concerns with the need for expanded air traffic, and that an environmental impact study was not necessary because the changes were for ""high altitude"" operations.
* Despite some concessions, such as reverting to pre-1987 flight patterns at night, the F.A.A. says it cannot roll back the new system during business hours due to growth in air traffic.
* Antinoise measures are pending at the state and federal level, including bills to require quieter aircraft and lawsuits against the F.A.A. and Port Authority.

The article highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental concerns, as well as the difficulties of addressing noise pollution issues that affect multiple communities. The fact that even a congressman, Matthew J. Rinaldo, has been affected by the noise adds to the sense of urgency and widespread impact of the issue.",0

1254,1254,9004060,347374,"The article discusses the economic impact of defense budget cuts on the town of Montville, Connecticut, where United Nuclear Corporation (UNC) is located. UNC has been a major employer in the area, with many workers engaged in classified work on nuclear reactors for the US Navy's submarine program. However, due to the end of the Cold War and subsequent defense spending reductions, UNC has announced layoffs, which will have a significant impact on the local economy.

The article highlights the concerns of UNC employees, who feel that they have contributed to the country's national security through their work and now face uncertainty about their livelihoods. They are seeking government assistance to either provide enough work to sustain the company or attract non-defense industries to the area.

Local officials and lawmakers, including Representative John Rowland and Senator Christopher Dodd, have promised to explore options to help UNC and the affected workers. These include introducing legislation to allow UNC to compete with other companies for defense contracts, urging the Department of Energy to provide UNC with non-defense projects, and allowing the company to work with foreign nations.

The article also notes that Electric Boat, another major defense contractor in the area, is more optimistic about its future due to ongoing submarine construction programs. However, the layoffs at UNC are expected to have a ripple effect on the local economy, affecting businesses such as real estate and restaurants.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by communities that are heavily reliant on defense industries as the US reduces its military spending in the post-Cold War era. It emphasizes the need for government support and diversification efforts to mitigate the economic impact of these changes.",0

1338,1338,9007040,370685,"This article discusses the tax revolt in New Jersey, led by a group called Hands Across New Jersey, which is protesting Governor James Florio's tax increase. The group has collected hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition demanding the repeal of the tax increase, but experts say the petition has no legal standing due to the state's lack of initiative and referendum provisions.

The article notes that 80% of New Jersey residents are dissatisfied with Florio's tax program, and only 23% believe he is doing a good job as Governor. Despite this, Florio plans to wage a campaign to bring his case to the public and potentially cut taxes in 1992 if his plan works.

The article also mentions that some counties in New Jersey are allowing voters to participate in nonbinding referendums on the tax package, which could send a message to the Governor and legislators. However, experts caution that initiative and referendum may not be an effective solution to complex problems, and that the state's representative form of government allows for negotiation and compromise.

Overall, the article suggests that while the tax revolt in New Jersey is gaining momentum, it remains to be seen whether the efforts of Hands Across New Jersey and other groups will lead to significant changes in the state's tax policies. 

Key points:

* Hands Across New Jersey has collected hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition demanding the repeal of Governor Florio's tax increase.
* The petition has no legal standing due to the state's lack of initiative and referendum provisions.
* 80% of New Jersey residents are dissatisfied with Florio's tax program, and only 23% believe he is doing a good job as Governor.

1366,1366,9008073,377760,"This article reports on the trial of three defendants - Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, and Raymond Santana - who were accused of raping a white female investment banker in Central Park in 1989. The case was highly publicized due to its brutal nature and the fact that the defendants were young black and Hispanic males.

The article notes that the prosecution's case relied heavily on the confessions of the defendants, which were obtained through intense police questioning. The defense argued that the confessions were coerced and unreliable.

The trial was marked by racial tensions and controversy, with many in the black community feeling that the defendants were being railroaded and that the case was an example of systemic racism. Some protesters outside the courtroom vilified the victim, accusing her of being sexually promiscuous and questioning her reasons for being in the park on the night of the attack.

The article also notes that the case was seen as a symbol of the city's helplessness in the face of violent crime, particularly crimes committed by teenagers. The verdict was seen as a major victory for the prosecution, despite the lack of physical evidence or eyewitnesses.

In the end, the jury delivered a guilty verdict on several counts, including rape and assault. The defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 5 to 15 years.

The article concludes by noting that the case will likely have a lasting impact on the city, with many still divided over issues of racism and justice. The Reverend Al Sharpton, a leader of the protests outside the courtroom, predicted that the convictions would ""inflame the city.""

It's worth noting that in 2002, DNA evidence confirmed that another man, Matias Reyes, was the sole perpetrator of the crime. Reyes had committed several other rapes in the same area around the same time and had confessed to the crime while already serving a prison sentence for another offense. The convictions of the five men originally accused of the crime (including Korey Wise and Kevin Richardson, who were tried separately) were vacated, and they were exonerated.",0

1455,1455,9101005,412518,"The article discusses the issue of acquaintance rape on college campuses, where a woman is raped by someone she knows, often after a social encounter or date. The problem is complex and multifaceted, involving societal attitudes, communication breakdowns, and power dynamics.

According to experts, women need to take responsibility for their own safety, trust their instincts, and learn how to avoid vulnerable situations. They should also be aware of the signals they send, both spoken and non-spoken, to avoid miscommunication. Men, on the other hand, need to educate themselves about what is permissible in various situations and understand that ""no"" means ""no.""

The article highlights that many men have been socialized to pursue women for sex and may interpret a woman's initial refusal as a sign of attraction or an invitation to continue pursuing her. This attitude can lead to misunderstandings and, ultimately, to rape.

Universities are taking steps to address the issue through education programs, improved reporting mechanisms, and counseling services. Some institutions have initiated men-only discussion groups to raise awareness about the problem and promote healthy attitudes towards sex and relationships.

The article concludes that the conversation around acquaintance rape is essential for raising awareness and promoting change. By educating students about consent, boundaries, and respect, colleges can help prevent these crimes and create a safer campus environment.

Key takeaways:

1. Acquaintance rape is a significant problem on college campuses.
2. Women need to take responsibility for their own safety and learn how to avoid vulnerable situations.
3. Men need to educate themselves about consent and understand that ""no"" means ""no.""
4. Universities are taking steps to address the issue through education programs, improved reporting mechanisms, and counseling services.
5. Raising awareness and promoting healthy attitudes towards sex and relationships can help prevent acquaintance rape.

Some potential discussion questions:

1. How can colleges balance the need for education and prevention with the potential backlash from students who feel that they are being unfairly targeted or stigmatized?
2. What role should men play in preventing acquaintance rape, and how can they be encouraged to take an active role in promoting healthy attitudes towards sex and relationships?
3. How can universities ensure that their education programs and services are effective in reducing the incidence of acquaintance rape on campus?

Overall, the article highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address it. By educating students, promoting healthy attitudes, and providing support services, colleges can help create a safer and more respectful campus environment.",0
1456,1456,9101006,412518,"The article discusses the issue of acquaintance rape on college campuses, highlighting the complexities and nuances surrounding this problem. Key points include:

1. **Lack of awareness and understanding**: Many students, particularly men, are unclear about what constitutes consent and may misinterpret a woman's ""no"" as a sign to continue pursuing her.
2. **Socialization of men**: Men are often socialized to pursue women for sex, with some believing that initial refusals are part of a ""mating game"" ritual. This can lead them to translate a woman's ""no"" into meaning ""yes"".
3. **Pressure and entitlement**: College-age men may feel pressure from their peers to ""score"" and may assume that a woman's presence in their bedroom or a fraternity house is an invitation for sex.
4. **Miscommunication**: Men and women may have different understandings of terms like ""hooking up"", with men often interpreting it as having sex, while women may see it as kissing or fondling.
5. **Importance of education and awareness**: Colleges and universities are taking steps to educate students about acquaintance rape, including seminars, lectures, and orientation sessions.
6. **Need for personal responsibility**: Women need to take responsibility for their own safety and be aware of their surroundings, while men need to educate themselves about what is permissible in various situations.
7. **Impact on campuses**: Acquaintance rape can have serious consequences for victims, perpetrators, and the campus community as a whole, including increased insurance rates and potential lawsuits.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""When things start moving quickly, that's the time to get out, move fast, kick up a fuss."" - Ms. Brownmiller
* ""Women need to take the responsibility in educating themselves... They are calling it a man's problem, but I think it's all of our problem."" - Kim Wible
* ""College-age kids nowadays have a different attitude toward sex... They regard it almost as an entitlement, certainly as an expectation."" - Lawrence K. Pettit

1. **Misconceptions about consent**: Many men believe that a woman's initial ""no"" means ""yes"" or that she is playing hard to get. This mindset can lead to misunderstandings and, ultimately, to acquaintance rape.
2. **Lack of communication**: Men and women often have different understandings of what constitutes consent, and this lack of communication can lead to misinterpretations.
3. **Socialization of men**: Men are often socialized to pursue women for sex and may feel pressure from their peers to ""score."" This can contribute to a culture that normalizes coercive behavior.
4. **Women's responsibility**: While women are not responsible for being raped, they can take steps to protect themselves, such as trusting their instincts, being aware of their surroundings, and communicating their boundaries clearly.
5. **Education and awareness**: Colleges and universities are beginning to address the issue of acquaintance rape through education programs, counseling services, and policy changes.
6. **Insurance and liability**: Institutions are also taking steps to protect themselves from lawsuits related to acquaintance rape, including purchasing insurance policies that cover such incidents.

1458,1458,9101004,412626,"The article discusses a controversy at San Francisco State University over a course on black politics taught by Professor Smith, a member of the political science department. The course was seen as an encroachment on the territory of the School of Ethnic Studies, which offers similar courses. The incident highlights the tensions between traditional academic departments and ethnic studies programs, with some arguing that the latter are being undermined by the former.

Dr. T'Shaka, a professor in the School of Ethnic Studies, believes that the university is trying to weaken ethnic studies by allowing duplication of courses, which would ultimately lead to the absorption of these programs into traditional disciplines. He argues that this is part of a broader pattern of discrimination against ethnic studies, which are treated as second-class citizens on campus.

On the other hand, Professor Smith contends that his course gives legitimacy to the study of black politics and that it is not an attack on ethnic studies. He believes that the conflict is driven by personal attacks and a desire to silence him for holding an unpopular view.

The article also notes that this controversy reflects a larger trend in American higher education, where ethnic studies programs are facing challenges as they try to establish themselves as legitimate academic disciplines. Despite the growth of non-European studies on campuses, there is still a sense of marginalization and paranoia among ethnic studies faculty, who feel that their programs are not being taken seriously.

The incident has sparked a debate about the role of ethnic studies in the academy and the need for greater coordination and cooperation between traditional departments and ethnic studies programs. Some educators argue that ethnic studies should be integrated into the broader curriculum, while others believe that separate departments are necessary to preserve the unique perspectives and approaches of these fields.

Overall, the article suggests that the controversy at San Francisco State is part of a larger struggle for recognition and legitimacy in the academy, where ethnic studies programs are fighting to establish themselves as equal partners in the academic enterprise.",0

1474,1474,9101032,414957,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding a New Jersey law that prohibits employers from discriminating against job applicants or employees based on their smoking habits outside of work. Some companies, such as Siefert and Fortunoff, have policies in place that refuse to hire smokers due to concerns about fire safety and employee health.

Opponents of the legislation argue that it is unnecessary and that employers should be able to make hiring decisions based on their own preferences, including whether or not an applicant smokes. They also point out that smoking is a major public health concern, responsible for 400,000 deaths per year in the US, and that employers should be able to take steps to control rising healthcare costs associated with smoking.

Experts on constitutional and civil rights issues agree, stating that making it a civil right to smoke is ""ludicrous"" and that employers should be able to require higher health insurance contributions from employees who choose to smoke. Some lawmakers also argue that the legislation sends a terrible message by elevating a self-destructive habit like smoking to the class of a protected right.

On the other hand, supporters of the legislation, such as State Senator Francis J. McManimon, argue that dismissing or refusing to hire someone because they smoke at home is discrimination and should be dealt with as such. They also question whether there is evidence to support the claim that smoking causes increased absenteeism.

Some key points from the article include:

* Fortunoff's employment ads specify ""no smokers"" and the company has a policy of not hiring smokers due to fire safety concerns.
* State Assemblyman John E. Rooney, a former smoker, argues that employers should be able to prefer nonsmokers for hiring due to the addictive nature of smoking.
* Experts argue that making smoking a civil right is unnecessary and could prevent employers from taking steps to control healthcare costs associated with smoking.
* Some lawmakers, such as State Senator Gabriel D. Ambrosio, argue that the legislation sends a terrible message by promoting a self-destructive habit like smoking.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding the New Jersey law and the differing opinions on whether or not employers should be able to discriminate against smokers.",0

1489,1489,9102007,421074,"The debate on condom distribution in schools is a contentious issue, with proponents arguing it's essential for preventing HIV transmission among teenagers and opponents claiming it promotes promiscuity. Here are some key points from the perspectives of various individuals:

**Proponents:**

1. **Rose Merola**: A retired paraprofessional who believes that providing condoms will empower students to make informed decisions about their sexual health.
2. **Ruth W. Messinger**: The Borough President of Manhattan, who compares condom distribution to teaching kids to cover their mouths when coughing to prevent the spread of diseases.
3. **Deborah Glick**: An Assemblywoman from Greenwich Village, who notes that teenagers are already engaging in sexual activity and that denying them access to condoms is a ""criminal dereliction of duty.""
4. **Alan Ettman**: A teacher at Walton High School in the Bronx, who argues that condoms can save lives and that their distribution is a moral imperative.
5. **Erica Zurer**: A member of Community School Board 13 in Brooklyn and a parent, who believes that providing condoms shows that policymakers care about protecting teenagers.

**Opponents:**

1. **Helen O'Neill**: A Brooklyn mother who thinks that handing out condoms will promote promiscuity and undermine parental authority.
2. **Brother David Carroll**: A teacher at Christian Brothers, who questions whether ""safe sex"" is an appropriate lesson for schools to teach.
3. **Carol Wood**: A paralegal who warns that distributing defective condoms could lead to personal liability for board members.
4. **Catherine Le Clair**: A bursar at Fontvonne Hall Academy, who believes that condom distribution will stimulate the imagination of young people and promote promiscuity.
5. **Guy V. Molinari**: The Borough President of Staten Island, who thinks that distributing condoms condones and promotes sexual promiscuity in schools.

**Common themes:**

1. **Parental authority vs. school responsibility**: Opponents argue that parents should be responsible for teaching their children about sex and condom use, while proponents believe that schools have a role to play in providing education and resources.
2. **Promoting promiscuity**: Opponents claim that distributing condoms will encourage teenagers to engage in sexual activity, while proponents argue that this is not supported by evidence and that condoms can save lives.
3. **Moral implications**: Both sides frame their arguments in moral terms, with opponents arguing that condom distribution undermines traditional values and proponents arguing that it is a moral imperative to protect young people from HIV transmission.

Overall, the debate highlights the complexities of addressing adolescent sexual health and the need for nuanced discussions about the role of schools, parents, and policymakers in promoting healthy behaviors among young people.",0

1535,1535,9104018,438098,"Here is a summary of the article:

A nationwide rail strike began on Wednesday, affecting freight and passenger trains across the United States. The strike, involving eight or nine unions representing 235,000 workers, was called after three years of negotiations with the nation's 10 biggest freight companies failed to produce an agreement. The main issues in dispute include the number of people required to run a train, the distance a worker must travel to be credited for a full day's work, and wages.

Despite initial fears of widespread disruptions, many businesses had stockpiled supplies and were able to continue operating. However, some industries, such as the automobile sector, were expected to be severely affected. Commuters in some areas, such as Silicon Valley and Chicago, were also impacted, although some commuter services were able to continue operating.

The federal government intervened in the dispute, with President Bush appointing a Presidential Emergency Board to propose compromises. However, the unions rejected many of the board's recommendations, leading to the strike. Congress was considering legislation to end the strike, but some lawmakers expressed discomfort with intervening in a labor-management dispute.

The strike was expected to have significant economic implications, particularly for industries that rely heavily on rail transportation, such as coal mining and manufacturing. However, many businesses had taken steps to mitigate the impact of the strike, and some commuter services were able to continue operating.",0

1554,1554,9105022,446270,"The article discusses the increasing diversity on college campuses, particularly at the University of California, Berkeley, and how it is leading to a rise in ethnic and racial separatism. While some students are embracing their cultural identities and forming alliances with others who share similar backgrounds, others are struggling to navigate this new landscape.

According to Troy Duster, director of the Institute for the Study of Social Change at Berkeley, as minority enrollment has risen, racial awareness has intensified, and students are grappling with how to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds. Duster's study found that many students want to experience different cultures but have trouble understanding the actions of other groups and often segregate themselves for self-defense or mutual support.

The article highlights various approaches being taken by colleges to promote diversity and inclusivity, such as special dorms or houses for specific ethnic or racial groups. For example, Stanford University has four special ethnic dorms, including Casa Zapata, which is themed around Hispanic culture but also includes students from other backgrounds.

Casa Zapata is presented as a model of successful integration, where students from different cultures come together and learn from each other. The article quotes Cecilia Preciado Burciaga, an associate dean of students, who says that ""maybe now is the time to look for common ground rather than just celebrating differences.""

The article also includes personal stories of students who have benefited from living in diverse environments. For example, Stacey Strong, a first-year student from a predominantly white community, initially found it difficult to adjust to life at Casa Zapata but eventually came to appreciate the differences between herself and her Hispanic roommates.

Overall, the article suggests that while there are challenges associated with increasing diversity on college campuses, there are also opportunities for growth and learning. By embracing their differences and seeking common ground, students can develop a deeper understanding of themselves and others, which is essential for success in an increasingly multicultural world.

Key points:

* Increasing diversity on college campuses is leading to a rise in ethnic and racial separatism.
* Students are struggling to navigate this new landscape and find ways to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds.
* Colleges are trying various approaches to promote diversity and inclusivity, such as special dorms or houses for specific ethnic or racial groups.
* Successful integration requires finding common ground and celebrating differences.
* Personal stories of students who have benefited from living in diverse environments highlight the importance of embracing differences and seeking understanding.",0

1577,1577,9107014,458452,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the use of Alar, a chemical used to ripen apples, and its potential health risks. In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) released a report claiming that Alar posed a significant cancer risk to children who consumed apples treated with the chemical. The report sparked widespread media attention, including a segment on ""60 Minutes,"" which featured actress Meryl Streep warning about the dangers of Alar.

The resulting public panic led to a significant decline in apple sales, with prices falling to their lowest levels in years. Apple growers, who had not used Alar on their crops, were particularly affected, with many forced to dump their produce or give it away to organizations for the homeless.

However, subsequent reviews of the NRDC's findings by British and California authorities concluded that the cancer risk from Alar was minimal. The apple industry and some scientists criticized the NRDC for its ""irresponsible"" report, which they claimed was based on discredited research.

The controversy has had a lasting impact on the apple industry, with many growers still feeling bitter about the damage to their reputation. A lawsuit filed by Washington state apple growers against CBS and the NRDC is pending, alleging that the defendants recklessly disparaged the product.

The article also highlights the role of public relations in shaping public opinion, with David Fenton, the president of Fenton Communications, boasting about his strategy to create a media frenzy around the Alar issue. The episode has raised questions about the balance between informing the public about potential health risks and avoiding unnecessary panic.

Key points:

1599,1599,9108003,464437,"The article discusses the tense relationship between the Milwaukee Police Department and the community, particularly in the aftermath of the Jeffrey Dahmer case. The department is criticized for its handling of the case, with many feeling that the officers involved were insensitive and dismissive of the concerns of the gay community.

The article highlights the long-standing issues within the police department, including a reputation for being hostile to minority groups and a lack of diversity among its ranks. Despite efforts by the current chief, Philip Arreola, to reform the department and improve community relations, many feel that not enough has been done to address these problems.

The gay community in Milwaukee is particularly frustrated with the police department, citing instances of harassment and neglect. They are calling for improved training and a liaison officer to work with their community.

Not all residents of Milwaukee share this negative view of the police, however. Some express support for the department and its officers, acknowledging the difficulties of policing in a tough neighborhood.

The article concludes by noting that the current tensions between the police and the community are not new, but rather part of a long-standing pattern of distrust and frustration. It remains to be seen whether the department will be able to address these issues and improve its relationship with the community.

Some key points from the article include:

* The Milwaukee Police Department has a reputation for being hostile to minority groups, particularly in the gay community.
* The department has been criticized for its handling of the Jeffrey Dahmer case, with many feeling that the officers involved were insensitive and dismissive of the concerns of the gay community.

1616,1616,9108054,468341,"This article from The New York Times reports on the events surrounding a traffic accident in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that led to widespread violence and unrest between the black and Jewish communities. Here are the key points:

1. **Traffic Accident**: A station wagon driven by Yoseph Lisef (later corrected to Yosef Lifsh), a follower of the Lubavitcher Grand Rebbe Menachem Schneerson, struck and killed 7-year-old Gavin Cato and injured his sister Angela.
2. **Rioting and Violence**: The accident sparked rioting and violence in the area, with black youths attacking Jewish residents and property. A visiting rabbinical student, Yankel Rosenbaum, was stabbed and killed in an apparent retaliation for the accident.
3. **Allegations of Preferential Treatment**: Black residents complained that the police had given preferential treatment to the Hasidic community, which they felt contributed to the tensions between the two groups.
4. **Investigation**: Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown acknowledged that there were complaints about preferential treatment and said he was looking into them.
5. **Arrests**: Two individuals, including a 16-year-old named Limerick Nelson, were arrested in connection with Rosenbaum's stabbing.

The article highlights the deep-seated tensions between the black and Jewish communities in Crown Heights, which had been simmering for years.

1619,1619,9108033,469008,"The article discusses the issue of residency requirements for municipal employees, such as police officers, firefighters, and teachers, in New Jersey cities like Trenton and Camden. While some cities have residency ordinances, many employees find ways to circumvent them by establishing temporary residences or renting apartments with colleagues. This allows them to live outside the city while still working there.

The article highlights the concerns of city officials, residents, and union representatives regarding the impact of non-resident employees on the community. Some argue that residency requirements help create a sense of community and encourage employees to take pride in their work, as they have a personal stake in the city's well-being. Others believe that residency requirements are unfair or unenforceable.

Union officials representing uniformed employees, such as firefighters, are pushing for legislation to abolish all residency requirements, allowing state residents to compete for jobs in any municipality. In contrast, union representatives for non-uniformed employees, like clerical workers and laborers, argue that residency requirements should be expanded and more strictly enforced to ensure fairness.

The article also quotes residents who feel that police officers, firefighters, and teachers who live outside the city are less invested in the community and may not take their jobs as seriously. However, some employees counter that living and working in the same city can be exhausting and that they should not be expected to be ""on duty"" 24 hours a day.

Key points:

1. Many municipal employees in New Jersey cities find ways to circumvent residency requirements.
2. City officials and residents are concerned about the impact of non-resident employees on the community.
3. Union representatives for uniformed employees want to abolish all residency requirements, while those representing non-uniformed employees want to expand and enforce them.
4. Residents believe that employees who live in the city take more pride in their work and are more invested in the community.
5. Employees argue that living and working in the same city can be exhausting and that they should not be expected to be ""on duty"" 24 hours a day.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities of residency requirements for municipal employees and the need for a balanced approach that considers both the needs of employees and the impact on the community.",0

2. **Recycling and reuse**: The US Air Force is exploring ways to recycle or destroy retired missiles, including using super-cold liquid nitrogen or high-pressure hot water to remove fuel from metal casings.
3. **Anaerobic microorganisms**: Researchers are investigating the use of special microorganisms that can digest some components of rocket fuel, converting them into a simple salt.
4. **Start treaty**: The treaty requires the destruction of missile silos, submarines, and bombers, but allows for the reuse of spare missiles under strict guidelines.
5. **Conversion to commercial launchers**: There is debate about whether retired US missiles should be converted into civil and commercial launchers, with some experts arguing it would benefit scientific research, while others fear it could harm the private launching industry.
6. **Environmental concerns**: Environmental groups are concerned that an increase in small rocket launches could damage the ozone layer.
7. **Destruction or recycling**: Many experts believe that due to their age and reliability issues, many retired missiles will ultimately be destroyed or recycled for their materials.

1651,1651,9109040,475605,"The article discusses the case of developer Joseph Arcuri, who began construction on a $300,000 condominium project in Dobbs Ferry, New York, but faced financial difficulties due to a depressed real estate market and the failure of City Federal Savings Bank, which had provided him with a $25.6 million mortgage commitment. As a result, Arcuri accumulated significant debts, including unpaid taxes and liens to the Village of Dobbs Ferry and the Town of Greenburgh, as well as debts to contractors who were not paid for their work.

The site has become an environmental hazard, with pollution in the adjacent creek and damage to the surrounding area. A group of plaintiffs, including the Dobbs Ferry Fishermen's Association and a friends group, have filed a lawsuit against Arcuri under the Clean Water Act, seeking to have the creek cleaned up and the situation remedied.

The plaintiffs' lawyer, Mr. Kennedy, states that their primary goal is to have the creek cleaned up and the situation remedied, and they will not agree to any settlement that does not include this. The defendants face potential penalties of $25,000 per day if found guilty in court.

Meanwhile, the Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit conservation organization, is working with Arcuri and the Resolution Trust Corporation to obtain land to provide public access to the waterfront area and possibly protect an archeological site on the property. Mercy College is also negotiating to buy the land and build a dormitory there, which would result in a significant loss of taxes for the village if realized.

Overall, the case highlights the complexities and challenges involved in resolving environmental hazards and debt disputes, particularly when multiple parties are involved and there are competing interests at play.",0

The dispute escalated when Ms. Cho was suspended without pay for 30 days, while Ms. Lee received only a three-day suspension. Many reporters and editors at the paper felt that the disparity in punishment was unfair and signed petitions protesting the decision. They also sought help from the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWWU), which represents workers at another Korean-language daily in Manhattan.

After 14 of the paper's 21 reporters and editors signed union cards, two union officials went to the paper to demand recognition. However, they were turned away by the paper's president, Kim Byung Ho. Two days later, Mr. Kim announced that 17 people were being dismissed, including 15 reporters and editors, 10 of whom had signed union cards.

The ILGWWU filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), charging the newspaper with violating the law by discharging employees for union activity. The case is ongoing, and the union is seeking an injunction to require the paper to rehire the dismissed workers while the labor relations board tries to resolve the dispute.

The article notes that the NLRB process can be slow, taking two to five years to resolve, which could affect the outcome of the case. However, the union hopes to obtain a court order similar to one issued in another case, which ordered a company to rehire 208 workers who had been on strike since January 1990.

Key issues in the case include:

1. Unfair labor practices: The ILGWWU alleges that The Sae Gae Times engaged in unfair labor practices by discharging employees for union activity.
2. Union recognition: The union is seeking recognition as the representative of the paper's employees, but the management has refused to recognize it.
3. Retaliation: The dismissed workers claim that they were fired in retaliation for their union activities, which is prohibited under labor law.
4. Injunction: The ILGWWU is seeking an injunction to require the paper to rehire the dismissed workers while the labor relations board tries to resolve the dispute.

Overall, the case highlights the challenges faced by workers trying to organize and bargain collectively in the United States, particularly in industries with a history of anti-union activity.",0

1677,1677,9110035,479255,"The article discusses the New York City Police Department's (NYPD) new community policing program, which aims to build relationships between police officers and the communities they serve. The program includes the use of Neighborhood Resource Centers, which are police vans equipped with telephones, radios, and fax machines that will be operated by police officers, city agency representatives, and volunteers to help residents deal with social problems such as drug abuse and family violence.

The article highlights the challenges of implementing community policing, including changing the mindset of older police officers who may view the approach as too ""soft"" or not in line with traditional law enforcement methods. However, some officers, such as Sergeant Terrence Magagnos, are enthusiastic about the new approach and believe it will lead to better results for the community.

The article also mentions a new award created by Police Commissioner Brown, called Citizen of the Month, which recognizes residents who work with the police to tackle neighborhood problems. The first recipient of this award was Reverend Hardy Smallwood, a Brooklyn minister who helped rid an apartment building of drug dealing and violence.

Additionally, the article notes that the NYPD is working on ways to recognize uniformed officers for their success in making neighborhoods better places, rather than just rewarding bravery or arrests. Officer Thomas Collins, who saved 25 weddings by intervening in a dispute at a bridal store, received a Cop of the Month Award for his compassionate and problem-solving approach.

Overall, the article suggests that community policing is a significant shift in the NYPD's approach to law enforcement, one that emphasizes building relationships and solving problems rather than just making arrests. While there may be challenges in implementing this new approach, many officers and community leaders believe it has the potential to make a positive impact on neighborhoods across the city.

Some of the key points from the article include:

* The NYPD is launching a community policing program to build relationships between police officers and the communities they serve.
* The program includes the use of Neighborhood Resource Centers, which are police vans equipped with telephones, radios, and fax machines.
* The program aims to help residents deal with social problems such as drug abuse and family violence.
* Some police officers may be resistant to the new approach, which emphasizes community building over traditional law enforcement methods.
* The NYPD is working on ways to recognize uniformed officers for their success in making neighborhoods better places.
* Community leaders believe that community policing has the potential to make a positive impact on neighborhoods across the city.",0

1688,1688,9111001,483981,"This article discusses the innovative approach to policing implemented by New Haven Police Chief, Nick Pastore. The Chief has gained attention for his unconventional methods, including advocating for decriminalization and medicalization of drug problems, rather than relying solely on interdiction. He encourages officers to treat first-time offenders with kindness and understanding, directing them towards treatment instead of arrest.

The Chief's vision is to implement ""21st-century policing,"" which focuses on community-oriented policing. He plans to open 12 permanent police substations throughout the city, where officers will work closely with residents to build trust and address problems before they escalate. The goal is to create a more service-oriented police force that prioritizes understanding and empathy over traditional law enforcement methods.

While some have praised the Chief's approach, others have expressed skepticism and even anger. Some officers feel that the Chief has stereotyped them as being ineffective and that his methods are too soft on crime. The police union president, Sergeant Cavalier, argues that the Chief's approach is unrealistic and puts officers in danger.

Despite these criticisms, some community members have seen positive changes since the implementation of community policing. Crime complaints have decreased in some areas, with reported robberies down 24%, rapes down 21%, and burglaries down 14%. However, other crime statistics, such as homicides and assaults, remain a concern.

The article also mentions the arrival of a new assistant chief, Mr. Esserman, who has advised the Chief to improve his relationship with officers and address their concerns. Ultimately, the success of the Chief's approach will depend on its ability to reduce crime and improve community relationships in the long term.

Key points:

* New Haven Police Chief Nick Pastore advocates for decriminalization and medicalization of drug problems
* He encourages officers to treat first-time offenders with kindness and understanding, directing them towards treatment instead of arrest
* The Chief plans to implement ""21st-century policing"" through community-oriented policing and the opening of 12 police substations
* Some officers have expressed skepticism and anger towards the Chief's approach, feeling it is too soft on crime
* Crime complaints have decreased in some areas, but other statistics, such as homicides and assaults, remain a concern
* The success of the Chief's approach will depend on its ability to reduce crime and improve community relationships in the long term.",0

1715,1715,9111038,487815,"This article appears to be a character study of two individuals, Julio Rivera and Daniel Doyle, who were involved in a tragic event, likely a crime or violent incident. The text provides a detailed background on each person's life, personality, and experiences.

Julio Rivera:

* Grew up in the South Bronx with a neglectful family and dropped out of school in the 7th grade
* Moved to Manhattan as a teenager and was introduced to a world of luxury and excess by wealthy older men
* Developed a love for fine things, including theater, food, wine, and designer clothes
* Had a softer, sensitive side that he only revealed to those close to him
* Was ashamed of his lack of formal education and struggled with math
* Was a generous person who loved extravagant gestures and was a soft touch for beggars
* Struggled with feelings of unhappiness and insecurity, particularly due to his mother's death and the stigma of being from the South Bronx

Daniel Doyle:

* Grew up in a loving family with affectionate parents and two doting sisters
* Had a privileged upbringing, with his father working multiple jobs to support his education
* Attended prep school and college, where he studied literature and had a 3.4 GPA
* Was considered ""preppy"" in his neighborhood, but had a more alternative image at college
* Became involved with the DMS gang, which was known for its violent history, but not specifically for gay-bashing or bias crimes
* Was seen as a hanger-on rather than a core member of the gang and did not have tattoos or a police record
* May have been going through a rebellious phase, trying to impress the gang members and engage in crazy behavior

The article suggests that these two individuals came from different worlds and had distinct personalities, but both were drawn into a world of excess and violence. The contrast between their backgrounds and experiences serves to highlight the complexities of their characters and the tragic events that unfolded.",0

1726,1726,9112001,490681,"This article discusses a Supreme Court case involving a hate-crime ordinance in St. Paul, Minnesota. The case centers around Russell Viktora, who burned a cross on the lawn of a black family, the Joneses, and was charged under the ordinance. Viktora's lawyer, Edward Cleary, argues that the law is too broad and could infringe upon free speech rights. Cleary claims that the law could prevent artists from depicting certain symbols or ideas, even if they are offensive.

The St. Paul ordinance prohibits the display of symbols that arouse anger or hostility based on race, religion, or other characteristics. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court has interpreted the law to only apply to ""fighting words"" that incite immediate violence. The court's ruling has raised questions about where to draw the line between protected speech and punishable conduct.

The case has sparked debate about the balance between free speech and hate-crime laws. Some argue that hate-crime laws are necessary to address the unique harm caused by such crimes, while others believe that they can be used to suppress unpopular ideas or opinions. The Anti-Defamation League, which has helped draft hate-crime laws, concedes that the St. Paul ordinance is not a model for other cities and states.

The Jones family, who were the targets of the cross-burning, support the hate-crime law and believe that it is necessary to address the specific harm caused by such acts. However, Viktora's lawyer argues that the law is too broad and could be used to suppress free speech.

The Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether the St. Paul ordinance is constitutional. The case has implications for the balance between free speech and hate-crime laws, and could set a precedent for how cities and states address similar issues in the future.

Some of the key arguments made in the article include:

* The St. Paul ordinance is too broad and could infringe upon free speech rights.
* The law could be used to suppress unpopular ideas or opinions.
* Hate-crime laws are necessary to address the unique harm caused by such crimes.
* The Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of the law, which limits it to ""fighting words,"" may not be sufficient to resolve First Amendment concerns.
* The case raises questions about where to draw the line between protected speech and punishable conduct.

Some of the key stakeholders mentioned in the article include:

* Russell Viktora: The defendant who burned a cross on the Joneses' lawn.
* Edward Cleary: Viktora's lawyer, who argues that the law is too broad and could infringe upon free speech rights.
* Tom Foley: The Ramsey County Attorney, who argues that the law is necessary to address hate crimes and that it can be interpreted narrowly to avoid First Amendment concerns.
* Russ and Laura Jones: The family who were targeted by the cross-burning and support the hate-crime law.
* Steven Freeman: Director of legal affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, which has helped draft hate-crime laws and concedes that the St. Paul ordinance is not a model for other cities and states.",0

1809,1809,9204010,520084,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding Cracker Barrel's policy of discriminating against homosexual employees. In 1991, the company fired several employees for being gay, citing a company policy that prohibited hiring ""homosexuals"" due to their ""lifestyle"". The company claimed that this policy was necessary to maintain a wholesome family atmosphere in its restaurants.

The article notes that Cracker Barrel's policy is perfectly legal, as federal civil rights law does not protect homosexuals from workplace discrimination. However, many advocacy groups and investors have criticized the company for its stance, arguing that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discriminates against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

One of the employees who was fired, Todd Frisbee, recounted his experience of being terminated by two men in a parking lot, who told him that he was being let go due to his homosexuality. The company has refused to comment on the issue, with its chairman, Dan W. Evins, stating that Cracker Barrel is an equal opportunity employer that adheres to non-discrimination laws.

However, many have pointed out that this statement is misleading, as federal law does not protect homosexuals from discrimination. The article notes that none of the 15 states where Cracker Barrel operates have laws that prohibit discrimination against homosexuals, making it difficult for employees who are fired due to their sexual orientation to seek legal recourse.

The controversy has sparked protests and boycotts against Cracker Barrel, with many advocacy groups calling for a federal law to protect homosexuals from workplace discrimination. The article quotes William B. Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, as saying that the case highlights the need for federal protection against this type of discrimination.

Despite the controversy, Cracker Barrel's business has continued to grow, with sales increasing to $300 million in 1991. Many customers have expressed support for the company's stance, citing religious or moral objections to homosexuality. However, others have criticized the company for perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing debate over workplace discrimination against homosexuals and the need for greater protections under federal law. It also raises questions about the role of businesses in promoting social justice and equality, and the impact that companies like Cracker Barrel can have on marginalized communities.",0

1811,1811,9204030,523394,"The article discusses the oral arguments presented before the US Supreme Court in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenges the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania abortion law. The law requires women to wait 24 hours for an abortion after receiving informed consent information from doctors and mandates that married women notify their husbands of their intention to get an abortion.

The main arguments presented are:

1. **Strict Scrutiny**: The plaintiffs, represented by Ms. Kolbert, argue that the Court should apply strict scrutiny to the law, which would require the state to demonstrate a compelling interest in restricting access to abortion. They claim that upholding the law without applying strict scrutiny would effectively overrule Roe v. Wade.
2. **Rational Basis Test**: The Solicitor General, Mr. Starr, argues that the Court should apply a rational basis test, which is a lower level of constitutional protection. This would allow the state to restrict access to abortion as long as it serves a legitimate interest.

The justices' questions and comments suggest that:

1. **Justice Kennedy** may be open to reevaluating the standard of review for abortion cases, potentially moving away from strict scrutiny.
2. **Justice O'Connor** is concerned about the notification provision in the law, which requires married women to notify their husbands of their intention to get an abortion. She questions whether this provision is justified and suggests that it may be overly broad.
3. **Justice Souter** presses the Solicitor General on whether a rational basis test would justify complete prohibition of abortion, with some exceptions.

The article also mentions that:

1. **Roe v. Wade** established the right to abortion under strict scrutiny, but the Court has not consistently applied this standard in subsequent cases.
2. **The Webster decision** (1989) saw Justice Kennedy join Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice White in advocating for a rational basis standard, while Justice O'Connor proposed an ""undue burden"" standard.
3. **The Guam case**, which involves a law making abortion a crime unless it is done to save a woman's life or prevent grave danger to her health, may be affected by the Supreme Court's decision in this case.

Overall, the article suggests that the Supreme Court is grappling with the question of what standard to apply when evaluating restrictions on access to abortion and that the justices' opinions on this issue are likely to shape the outcome of the case.",0
1812,1812,9204036,523742,"The article describes the protests and counter-protests that took place in Buffalo, New York, in response to Operation Rescue's ""Spring of Life"" campaign, which aimed to block access to abortion clinics. The pro-choice group, Buffalo United for Choice (B.U.C.), mobilized thousands of volunteers to defend the clinics, while Operation Rescue brought in hundreds of anti-abortion protesters.

The protests were marked by intense confrontations between the two groups, with abortion-rights supporters shouting and chanting, while anti-abortion protesters prayed and chanted. The pro-choice group used tactics such as surrounding the anti-abortion leaders and blocking their access to the clinics, while the anti-abortion group tried to chain themselves to the clinic doors and entrances.

The article highlights the organizational efforts of both groups, with the pro-choice group receiving support from national organizations and training volunteers in clinic defense strategies. The anti-abortion group, led by Reverend Joseph Slovenec, also had a well-organized plan, including housing and financing for their protesters.

The article also profiles individual protesters on both sides, including Lucille VanZandt, who had an abortion and now regrets it, and Darcy D. France, who had an abortion and believes that women should have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies.

Overall, the article suggests that the protests in Buffalo were a significant moment in the national debate over abortion, with both sides dug in and determined to make their voices heard. The use of tactics such as civil disobedience and counter-protests reflects the intensity of the conflict and the deep divisions between those who support and oppose abortion rights.

Some possible discussion questions based on this article could include:

* What are the main arguments made by each side in the abortion debate, and how do they reflect deeper values and beliefs?
* How do the organizational efforts of both groups contribute to the intensity and effectiveness of their protests?
* What role do personal experiences and stories play in shaping individual perspectives on abortion, and how can they be used to build empathy and understanding between those who disagree?
* How do the protests in Buffalo reflect broader trends and conflicts in American society, such as the rise of social conservatism and the ongoing debate over women's rights?",0

1896,1896,9412044,730630,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding areas. The plan, approved by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in May, aims to release 15 Canadian gray wolves into the park by the end of 1994. However, the proposal has been met with opposition from ranchers and farmers who are concerned about the potential impact on their livestock.

The article highlights the emotional and complex nature of the issue, with both sides presenting strong arguments. On one hand, environmentalists and biologists argue that the reintroduction of wolves is essential for maintaining a balanced ecosystem in Yellowstone and that it will have numerous benefits for the park's biodiversity. They also point out that wolves are an important part of the park's natural heritage and that their presence will enhance the overall wilderness experience.

On the other hand, ranchers and farmers are worried about the potential economic losses they may incur if wolves attack their livestock. They argue that the government's plan to compensate them for any losses is inadequate and that the presence of wolves will lead to a decline in property values and an increase in costs associated with protecting their animals.

The article also touches on the larger issue of land use in the West, with some groups arguing that the reintroduction of wolves is part of a broader effort to restrict human activity and lock up large areas of land for conservation purposes. The Mountain States Legal Foundation, which filed a lawsuit against the wolf plan, claims that the Endangered Species Act is being used as a tool to limit ranching and other economic activities in the region.

Despite the controversy, some ranchers have begun to see the potential benefits of having wolves in the area, including increased property values and the possibility of attracting tourists who are interested in seeing wolves in their natural habitat. However, others remain strongly opposed to the plan, citing concerns about the impact on their livelihoods and the lack of adequate compensation for any losses they may incur.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of the complex issues surrounding the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, highlighting the competing interests and values at play in this contentious debate. 

Some key points from the article include:

* The plan to reintroduce gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park has been approved by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
* Ranchers and farmers are opposed to the plan, citing concerns about the potential impact on their livestock and economic losses.
* Environmentalists and biologists argue that the reintroduction of wolves is essential for maintaining a balanced ecosystem in Yellowstone.
* The Endangered Species Act requires the government to preserve and restore any species threatened with extinction in ""all or a significant portion of its range.""
* Some ranchers have begun to see the potential benefits of having wolves in the area, including increased property values and tourism.
* The controversy surrounding the reintroduction of wolves is part of a larger debate about land use in the West and the role of the Endangered Species Act in restricting human activity.",0

1909,1909,9412092,731835,"The article discusses the challenges faced by Connecticut in reforming its welfare system. The state is struggling to find ways to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient and move off the rolls. Several pilot programs, such as Pathways and Family Strength, have been introduced to provide education, job training, and childcare assistance to welfare clients.

One of the main issues facing the state is the lack of jobs available for welfare recipients. Many of those who are cut from the rolls end up back on welfare due to a lack of stable employment opportunities. The city of Bridgeport has formed partnerships with local businesses and training schools to provide job training and placement services, but more needs to be done to address the underlying economic issues.

The article also highlights the cultural shift that is needed within the social services department to encourage clients to work and become self-sufficient. The traditional approach of simply providing financial assistance without expectations or support for employment is no longer seen as effective.

Some key statistics mentioned in the article include:

* 60% of the 750 welfare clients cut from Bridgeport's rolls last April are back on welfare
* More than 800 of the city's 2,200 able clients have been placed in permanent jobs through job training programs
* The state's Department of Social Services is running two pilot projects, Pathways and Family Strength, to provide education, job training, and childcare assistance to welfare clients

Overall, the article suggests that reforming the welfare system will require a multifaceted approach that addresses both the economic and cultural factors that contribute to dependency on government assistance. It will also require a commitment to providing individualized support and services to help clients overcome barriers to employment and become self-sufficient.

Some potential solutions mentioned in the article include:

* Providing education and job training programs tailored to the needs of welfare clients
* Offering childcare assistance and other forms of support to help clients balance work and family responsibilities
* Creating partnerships with local businesses and training schools to provide job placement services
* Focusing on individualized attention and support to help clients overcome specific barriers to employment
* Encouraging a cultural shift within the social services department to prioritize self-sufficiency and employment

However, the article also notes that these efforts may not be enough to address the underlying economic issues that contribute to poverty and dependency on government assistance. More comprehensive solutions, such as job creation programs and investments in education and training, may be needed to truly reform the welfare system and help clients achieve long-term self-sufficiency.",0

1925,1925,9412124,733250,"This article reports on the devastating effects of drunken driving accidents, highlighting the importance of raising awareness and enforcing stricter laws to prevent such tragedies. The story centers around a vigil held in Gales Ferry, Connecticut, where family members and friends of victims of drunken driving accidents gathered to share their stories and light candles in memory of their loved ones.

The article cites statistics on the decline in alcohol-related traffic deaths, attributing this trend to improved law enforcement, increased public awareness, and societal pressure against driving drunk. It also highlights the effectiveness of roadside sobriety checkpoints as a deterrent against drunken driving.

Several individuals who have lost family members or friends to drunken driving accidents share their personal stories, expressing their grief and advocating for stricter laws and more severe penalties for those convicted of drunken driving. They emphasize the need for increased awareness and education about the dangers of driving under the influence.

The article also discusses proposed legislation supported by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), including reducing the legally intoxicated level to .08 percent, prohibiting any alcohol in the body for drivers under age 21, and enabling police officers to use additional types of tests to determine the presence of drugs.

Key points from the article include:

1. **Decline in alcohol-related traffic deaths**: The number of alcohol-related traffic deaths has decreased due to improved law enforcement, increased public awareness, and societal pressure against driving drunk.
2. **Effectiveness of roadside sobriety checkpoints**: Checkpoints have resulted in 31 drunken driving arrests and act as a deterrent against drunken driving.
3. **Importance of designated drivers**: Choosing a designated driver is a socially acceptable and effective way to prevent drunken driving.
4. **Need for stricter laws and penalties**: Family members and friends of victims advocate for stricter laws and more severe penalties for those convicted of drunken driving.
5. **Proposed legislation**: MADD supports proposed legislation to reduce the legally intoxicated level, prohibit any alcohol in the body for drivers under 21, and enable police officers to use additional types of tests to determine the presence of drugs.

1929,1929,9412132,733750,"This article provides an in-depth look at the New York City Housing Court system, highlighting its complexities, challenges, and the people involved. Here are some key points and observations:

**The Court's Purpose**: The housing court was established in 1973 to handle disputes related to rent, repairs, and evictions. However, over time, the court has become increasingly focused on rent disputes, with 95% of cases now involving back rent.

**Tenant-Landlord Dynamics**: The article portrays a power imbalance between tenants and landlords, with many tenants feeling intimidated or taken advantage of by landlords and their lawyers. Tenants often lack legal representation, making it difficult for them to navigate the complex court system.

**Landlords' Perspective**: On the other hand, landlords argue that the system is biased against them, with lengthy and costly proceedings that can result in significant financial losses. They claim that tenants often abuse the system, staying in apartments without paying rent for extended periods.

**Judges' Role**: Housing court judges play a crucial role in mediating disputes and ensuring that both parties are treated fairly. They must balance the need to enforce rent payments with the need to protect tenants from unfair treatment. Judges like Laurie L. Lau and Pierre B. Turner are highlighted for their efforts to explain the law to litigants and ensure that justice is served.

**Challenges and Criticisms**: The article notes several challenges and criticisms of the housing court system, including:

* The lack of respect for judges, who are technically referees with five-year appointments.
* The private discipline system for judges, which has been criticized as inadequate (as seen in the case of Judge Arthur R. Scott Jr., who was arrested for allegedly accepting bribes).
* The limited resources and support available to tenants, particularly those without legal representation.

**Success Stories**: Despite the challenges, there are success stories, such as Daria Lanham's case, where a judge ordered her landlord to make repairs and face penalties if they were not completed. Ms. Lanham's experience in housing court has given her a newfound appreciation for the importance of being a responsible landlord.

Overall, the article provides a nuanced look at the complexities of the New York City Housing Court system, highlighting both the challenges and the successes. It underscores the need for continued reform and support to ensure that the system serves the needs of all parties involved, particularly vulnerable tenants.",0

1983,1983,9408001,703378,"The article provides an in-depth look at Cobb County, Georgia, a suburban area that has become a symbol of conservative values and a growing trend of people seeking simpler lives outside of urban centers. Here are some key points from the article:

2006,2006,9303042,597495,"The article discusses the challenges faced by the State University of New York (SUNY) at Old Westbury, a college located on Long Island. The college has a unique history and mission, having been founded in 1968 as an experimental institution with a focus on social justice and universal access to education. However, over the years, the college has struggled to balance its commitment to serving minority students with its role as a regional college in a predominantly white area.

The article highlights several issues that have contributed to the college's challenges, including:

1. **Budget cuts**: The college has suffered significant budget cuts, which have resulted in reduced resources and services for students.
2. **Lack of facilities**: Old Westbury is the only SUNY school without a student center, and many of its dorm rooms lack on-campus phone service.
3. **High student-faculty ratio**: The college has one of the highest student-faculty ratios in the SUNY system, which can make it difficult for students to receive individual attention and support.
4. **Perception of inferior education**: Some faculty members and students have reported that neighbors on Long Island perceive Old Westbury as a ""minority school"" that offers an inferior education.

Despite these challenges, many students and faculty members praise the college's commitment to diversity and social justice. The article quotes several students who credit the college with providing them with opportunities they might not have had otherwise.

The college's president, Dr. John D. McGuire, is quoted as saying that the college's mission is to provide ""universal access to education"" and to serve those who have been ""traditionally bypassed"" by colleges. However, this mission has been difficult to fulfill, particularly in the face of budget cuts and other challenges.

The article also mentions the controversy surrounding a warning from the Chancellor of the SUNY system, who suggested that the college's reputation might be hurt if it becomes too closely associated with serving minority students. Some students and faculty members have interpreted this warning as an attempt to limit the college's commitment to diversity and social justice.

Overall, the article suggests that Old Westbury is a college with a unique mission and a complex set of challenges. While it has made significant progress in serving minority students and promoting social justice, it continues to face difficulties in balancing its commitments with the needs of its students and the broader community.

Some possible solutions to the challenges faced by Old Westbury include:

1. **Increased funding**: The college needs more resources to support its students and faculty, particularly in areas such as facilities and academic programs.
2. **Improved facilities**: The college should prioritize the construction of a student center and other facilities that can support student life and academic success.
3. **Diversity and inclusion initiatives**: The college should continue to promote diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as outreach programs and cultural events, to foster a sense of community and belonging among students from all backgrounds.
4. **Community engagement**: The college should engage with the local community to address perceptions of inferior education and to promote its mission and values.

By addressing these challenges and continuing to prioritize its commitment to diversity and social justice, Old Westbury can fulfill its mission and provide high-quality educational opportunities to students from all backgrounds.",0

2018,2018,9304005,599472,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the logging industry in the Pacific Northwest, particularly with regards to the protection of old-growth forests and the northern spotted owl. The US government, led by President Clinton, is attempting to balance the competing interests of environmentalists and the timber industry.

The article describes how both sides are using various tactics to influence public opinion and sway the decisions of government officials. Environmental groups, such as Lighthawk, are flying journalists and politicians over clear-cut forests to show the devastating impact of logging, while the timber industry is claiming that replanting efforts are sufficient to replace harvested trees.

The article also highlights the exaggerations and misinformation being spread by both sides. For example, the timber industry has claimed that saving the old-growth forest would put 100,000 people out of work, a figure that is three times higher than the government's estimate. On the other hand, environmental groups have implied that very little old-growth forest remains, when in fact the Forest Service estimates that there are six million acres of fragmented old-growth forest.

President Clinton has called for a conference to bring together representatives from both sides and local communities to find common ground and develop a solution that balances the needs of the environment and the economy. The article notes that White House aides are hoping to keep exaggerations and spin doctors at bay by only inviting ""local"" people to the table, but there are already reports that some participants have been coached on how to speak in sound bites.

The article also includes the results of a New York Times/CBS News poll, which shows that Americans believe President Clinton cares about both jobs and the environment. The poll found that 47% of respondents think Clinton prioritizes jobs, while 33% think he prioritizes the environment, and 5% think he cares about both equally.

Overall, the article suggests that finding a solution to the controversy surrounding old-growth forests will be challenging, given the strongly held views and competing interests of the various stakeholders involved. However, it also notes that President Clinton's efforts to bring people together and find common ground may help to move the debate forward and ultimately lead to a more balanced and sustainable approach to forest management.

Some potential discussion questions based on this article could include:

* What are the main arguments for and against protecting old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest?
* How do you think the government should balance the competing interests of environmentalists and the timber industry?
* What role do you think misinformation and exaggeration play in shaping public opinion on environmental issues like this one?
* Do you think President Clinton's approach to bringing people together and finding common ground is likely to be effective in resolving this controversy? Why or why not?

Some potential thesis statements based on this article could include:

* The controversy surrounding old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest highlights the need for a more nuanced and balanced approach to environmental policy, one that takes into account both the economic and ecological impacts of human activities.
* Despite the challenges and complexities involved, President Clinton's efforts to bring people together and find common ground on the issue of old-growth forests represent a promising step towards developing a more sustainable and equitable approach to forest management.
* The spread of misinformation and exaggeration on environmental issues like the protection of old-growth forests undermines the ability of policymakers to make informed decisions and highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in public discourse.",0

2052,2052,9509045,786659,"The article discusses the deep-seated problems of racism and corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Black officers, including those who are part of the police force, share their experiences and perceptions of a department that they feel is not doing enough to address these issues. The article highlights several key points:

1. **Racism is embedded in the department**: Many black officers believe that racism is a pervasive problem within the LAPD, with some even comparing it to a ""cancer"" that needs to be addressed.
2. **Lack of support for those fighting bigotry and corruption**: Black officers feel that the police leadership does not provide sufficient support to those who want to fight against racism and corruption within the department.
3. **Inadequate discipline for rogue officers**: Despite promises made after high-profile incidents, such as the beating of Rodney King, black officers believe that the department has not done enough to discipline rogue officers or root out corruption.
4. **Skepticism among the community**: The problems within the LAPD have led to widespread skepticism and mistrust among the communities they serve, with some people viewing the police as an ""occupying force"".
5. **Disconnection between leadership and line officers**: Black officers on the front lines feel that the department's leadership is out of touch with their experiences and concerns, and that promises of progress and reform have not trickled down to them.

The article also mentions specific incidents and examples of racism within the department, including:

* A white female officer using a racial slur in front of her black partner
* The existence of a secret association of officers called ""Men Against Women"" that fought against the recruitment and promotion of female officers
* The taped comments of former detective Mark Fuhrman, which suggest a culture of racism and corruption within the department

Overall, the article paints a picture of a police department that is struggling to address deep-seated problems of racism and corruption, and where black officers feel marginalized and unsupported in their efforts to create positive change.",0

2091,2091,9511016,808176,"This article reports on the ongoing labor dispute between the Newspaper Guild and other unions, and the management of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, both owned by major media companies (Gannett and Knight-Ridder). Here are the main points from the article:

**Background**: The dispute began when the newspapers' management demanded significant concessions from the unions, including cuts in staff, changes to staffing rules, and the introduction of a merit-pay system. The unions have resisted these demands, leading to a prolonged strike.

**Current situation**: The strike has been ongoing for several months, with both sides dug in. Many union members have crossed picket lines to return to work, while others remain on strike. The newspapers' management claims that they are trying to eliminate inefficiencies and ""featherbedding,"" but the unions see this as an attempt to break their power.

**Consequences**: The strike has had significant consequences for both the newspapers and the community. Circulation has declined by 24%, and revenue has been lost due to boycotts by advertisers. The papers' reputation has also suffered, with many readers turning to alternative sources of news.

**Human toll**: The strike has taken a personal toll on many union members, who have seen their careers derailed, friendships broken, and families uprooted as they seek new jobs. Some have expressed feelings of betrayal by colleagues who crossed picket lines.

**Union response**: The Newspaper Guild has announced plans to launch its own weekly Sunday paper to compete with the newspapers and attract advertisers and readers. Union leaders remain determined to resist the management's demands and protect their members' interests.

**Management perspective**: Management representatives claim that they are not trying to break the unions, but rather to make necessary changes to ensure the papers' financial viability in a changing media landscape. They see the introduction of a merit-pay system as a way to reward talented employees and eliminate inefficiencies.

**Long-term implications**: Experts warn that the consequences of the strike could be long-lasting, with circulation declines potentially leading to a cycle of decline that is difficult to reverse. The dispute has also highlighted the changing business realities of the newspaper industry, where profits are increasingly prioritized over traditional journalistic values.

Overall, the article presents a complex and nuanced picture of a labor dispute that has significant implications for the future of the newspaper industry and the community it serves.",0
