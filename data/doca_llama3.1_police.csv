8701002,200,"The article is about a meeting between Mayor Koch and a group of black community leaders to discuss ways to improve the racial climate in New York City after the Howard Beach incident. The participants praised the Mayor's leadership and condemned the attack, but some also criticized his previous lack of sensitivity to black concerns.

Here are some key points from the article:

1. The meeting was an ad hoc group convened by the Mayor to discuss ways to improve the racial climate in the city.
2. The participants included a mix of community leaders, politicians, and civil rights activists.
3. The Mayor emphasized the need for more education and enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in areas such as housing, employment, and education.
4. Some participants criticized Police Commissioner Ward's suggestion that Mr. Maddox was motivated by money from a potential civil suit.
5. The Mayor praised the group for having a ""positive and exemplary"" atmosphere, unlike some previous meetings where he felt his concerns were dismissed.

As for what we can do to eliminate racism, here are some suggestions:

1. Educate ourselves and others about the impact of systemic racism on communities of color.
2. Support policies and initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all areas of life.
3. Listen to and amplify the voices of people from marginalized communities who are working towards racial justice.
4. Challenge and call out racist attitudes and behaviors when we see them.
5. Work to build bridges between different communities and create a sense of shared humanity.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of dialogue and collaboration in addressing racism and promoting social change. By listening to each other's perspectives and working together towards common goals, we can make progress towards creating a more just and equitable society for all."

8703001,17909,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding the use of road salt in Westchester County, New York. Here are some key points:

**Costly cleaning project**: The state refused to undertake a costly cleaning project to remove salt residue from wells and water supplies.

**Salt usage**: While reducing the ratio of salt to sand, municipal highway departments are using more salt overall than before. This is due to growing commuter numbers, particularly in northern towns with winding roads that require salt to remain safe.

**Environmental concerns**: Residents and officials are pressing for changes in road-salting practices, citing concerns about the environmental impact on vegetation and water supplies.

**Health guidelines**: The State Health Department has set guidelines for sodium levels in drinking water, with recommendations for those on restricted diets. However, there are no formal standards for permitted salt levels.

**Testing results**: Wells tested in North Salem had high sodium concentrations (up to 200mg/l) and chloride concentrations (up to 400mg/l), but these were within normal ranges when tested at other times in the winter season.

**Challenges**: The use of salt creates a ""Catch 22"" dilemma, where one must choose between the risk of automobile accidents and environmental damage. Some experts are hopeful that financial incentives and studies on reducing or eliminating salt use on certain roads will lead to a decrease in salt consumption.

Some quotes from local officials:

* Frank B. McKown (Bedford Association president): ""It's like butting your head against a wall.""
* Edward F. Kelly (Westchester Highway Supervisors Association president): ""Commuters are not thinking of the environment; they are thinking of getting home or to work.""
* Edward J. Kearin (Lewisboro Highway Superintendent): ""I think people are grateful that they have safe roads."""
8703002,17909,"Protest Information Extracted:

1. Costly cleaning project: The state refused to undertake a costly cleaning project, leading to frustration among residents and officials.
2. Salt usage concerns: Residents and officials are concerned about the excessive use of salt on roads, citing environmental damage and potential health risks from sodium contamination in drinking water.
3. Frustration with State Department of Transportation: Officials feel frustrated with the State Department of Transportation's refusal to change its road-salting practices, leading to continued pressure to reform.
4. Growing numbers of commuters: The increasing number of commuters using winding roads that require salt to remain safe is contributing to the growing use of salt on roads.
5. Environmental concerns: Highway superintendents acknowledge the environmental damage caused by excessive salt usage, but prioritize safety and convenience over environmental concerns.
6. No formal standards for sodium levels: There are no formal standards for the amount of sodium permitted in drinking water, although state guidelines exist for individuals with salt-restricted diets.
7. Sodium concentrations in North Salem wells: The wells tested in North Salem had sodium concentrations as high as 200 and chloride concentrations as high as 400, but were still within normal levels when not affected by recent road salt usage.

Key Quotes:

* ""It's like butting your head against a wall."" - Frank B. McKown, president of the Bedford Association
* ""For every person who says we are using too much salt, there is someone who says we are not using enough."" - Edward J. Kearin, Highway Superintendent of Lewisboro
* ""I think people are grateful that they have safe roads."" - Edward F. Kelly, president of the Westchester Highway Supervisors Association"

8704015,28943,"This article reports on tensions and conflicts between the Hasidic Jewish community and the African American community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The main issues mentioned include:

1. Real estate: Black residents have reported receiving numerous requests from Hasidic leaders to sell their homes, which they view as insensitive and a form of gentrification.
2. Security patrol: An all-white volunteer security patrol run by the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council has been criticized by black community leaders for being a ""vigilante"" squad that targets African Americans.
3. Development grants: The distribution of $295,138 in Community Development Agency grants has been questioned, with 45% going to the Jewish Community Council and only 14% to a black-controlled organization.

The article also highlights the sense of powerlessness felt by many black residents in Crown Heights, who feel that their community is being administered by whites. The situation has led to feelings of frustration, mistrust, and resentment between the two communities.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""What gall"" - Rev. Heron Sam, rector of St. Marks Episcopal Church, reacting to a request from Hasidic leaders to sell his church.
* ""It is the height of insensitivity"" - Wilbur LaBorde, black resident, responding to repeated requests to sell his home.
* ""You know if someone is mugged, you know the person is black. There is no secret about that. When you talk about crime in this neighborhood, it is a one-way street."" - Rabbi Yisroel Rosenfeld, director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council.
* ""Sometimes I feel like we are living in an apartheid state where a tiny minority is controlling our state"" - Anita Burson, executive and native Crown Heights resident.

Overall, the article suggests that deep-seated tensions and conflicts between the Hasidic Jewish community and African American community in Crown Heights may be difficult to resolve without significant changes in the way resources are distributed and community leadership operates."

8806009,151963,"This article reports on a contempt hearing for Tawana Brawley, who is accused of failing to comply with a subpoena to testify before a grand jury. The hearing was marked by tension and controversy, as lawyers for Brawley, Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason, sought to turn the proceeding into a trial of the State of New York's treatment of African Americans.

The article describes the scene outside the courtroom, where hundreds of people were unable to gain entry due to limited seating. The Brawley supporters, including Rev. Louis Farrakhan, were turned away by court officials.

Inside the courtroom, the lawyers for Brawley raised objections to various aspects of the hearing, including media coverage and the lack of seats available for their supporters. Mr. Maddox argued that African Americans have been subjected to 400 years of oppression and that this case was a manifestation of that systemic racism.

The judge ultimately ruled against Brawley, finding her in contempt and ordering her to appear before the grand jury. The article also quotes an attorney for Brawley's family, Mr. Abrams, who criticized the lawyers' performance at the hearing and suggested that they were seeking to create a martyr out of Tawana Brawley.

Following the hearing, a march was organized by Brawley supporters, which ended in front of the Social Services Department building. The event created an angry atmosphere, with chanting and shouting, but no violence or confrontation occurred.

Overall, this article highlights the contentious nature of the contempt hearing and the broader issues of racism and systemic injustice that underlie the case of Tawana Brawley."

8808041,173386,"The article discusses the plight of families who adopted children with special needs from state agencies in the 1970s and 1980s, only to discover that their children had severe emotional and behavioral problems due to past abuse or neglect. The parents interviewed for the article describe their children's symptoms, such as self-destructive behavior, aggression, and a lack of emotional attachment.

Many of these parents believe that their children are ""unattached"" children, a term coined by Dr. Ken Magid, who suggests that these children have been severely abused from birth and are unable to form emotional bonds later in life. The symptoms of unattached children reportedly worsen as they approach puberty.

The article highlights the frustration and helplessness felt by many adoptive parents who were not prepared for the challenges they would face in caring for their children. Some parents blame the state for hiding information about their child's past, while others are angry that they were given inadequate support or resources to help them cope with their child's needs.

The article also notes that some families may be forced to consider giving up custody of their children due to the financial and emotional burden of caring for a child with severe special needs. The case of Roberta and Clem Wendling, who had to surrender temporary custody of their 9-year-old daughter to the state due to her uncontrollable behavior, serves as an example.

Overall, the article paints a picture of adoptive families struggling to cope with the unexpected challenges of caring for children with special needs, often feeling overwhelmed by the lack of support and resources available to them."

* The downtown area of Hempstead is the site of controversy regarding a redevelopment project.
* Many businesses and residents in the area are opposed to the project, which they claim will lead to their displacement and dislocation.
* One business owner, Leonard Myers, stated that the plan ""is not the way to redo the community that's going to serve all the interests.""
* Another business owner, Howard Kalinsky, claimed that the redevelopment would be a ""pure, unadulterated rape"" because property owners would be forced to sell their properties at a low price.
* The protesters, who call themselves PUSH (People Uniting for Sensible Handling), have been meeting with Assemblywoman Hill and others to express their concerns.
* Some of the issues raised by the protesters include:
	+ Loss of tax revenue: If businesses are replaced, there may not be enough new revenue to make up for the loss.
	+ Potential for failure: If new businesses do not succeed, they may require tax abatements that eliminate revenue rather than generate it.
* The project has been delayed due to the controversy and uncertainty about funding."

8906041,261405,"This news article discusses the 20-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots, a pivotal event in the LGBTQ+ movement that marked a shift from tolerance to activism. The article highlights how the riots brought together people of different races and genders, creating a sense of community and solidarity.

The article also notes the significant changes that have occurred since Stonewall:

* Homosexuals are now an accepted part of society, with many politicians and institutions recognizing their rights.
* Laws prohibiting sodomy (homosexual acts) have been repealed or invalidated in 24 states.
* Federal courts have generally supported homosexual plaintiffs in cases where their rights were challenged.

However, the article also notes that there is still work to be done:

* The Supreme Court's 1986 decision upholding Georgia's sodomy law has slowed momentum for repeal of remaining laws.
* Some states still have sodomy laws on the books, which can be used to prosecute homosexuals.
* The Federal court system may be more conservative now, making it harder for homosexual activists to win cases.

The article concludes by noting that the focus of the gay rights movement has shifted from the courts to politics:

* AIDS has become a major issue, bringing new levels of organizing and access to policymakers.
* The Human Rights Campaign Fund, a political action committee, has become a significant player in elections.

Overall, this article highlights the progress made by the LGBTQ+ community over the past 20 years, while also acknowledging that there is still much work to be done."

* The grandfather clause exempted projects that met certain criteria by July 1, 1988.
* The exemption period was extended to July 3, 1989, benefiting developers.
* Environmentalists argue that this extension is illegal and unfairly benefits developers.
* Developers claim that the grandfather clause is not an exemption at all, but rather a recognition of projects that received preliminary approval from municipalities before the transition-area regulations took effect.
* Some developers spent ""large sums of money"" struggling to obtain approvals only to find out they now need to redesign their projects to accommodate buffer zones.
* Assemblywoman Maureen Ogden sponsored the original legislation and intended for the grandfather clause to benefit projects already in the pipeline, not start over from scratch.
* The regulations require not only preliminary approval but also exemption from Army Corps of Engineers regulations, making it difficult for projects that don't meet both criteria to proceed.
* Lawsuits against the Department of Environmental Protection are expected to range ""easily into the hundreds"".
* Developers argue that the state is going beyond its traditional role of regulating environmental issues and attempting to regulate land areas that are not environmentally at risk.
* Environmentalists disagree, citing the importance of transition zones for flood protection and ecological balance.

8908006,272660,"This news article discusses a plan by the New Jersey Department of Education to revise its special education system, which aims to help students with mild learning problems without labeling them as ""handicapped."" The current system requires a formal classification process for students with disabilities, but the new plan would eliminate this requirement and provide resources for regular education classes.

The article quotes Dr. Jeffrey Osowski, director of the State Department of Education's Division of Special Education, who emphasizes that the goal is to serve these students effectively without the stigma of being labeled ""handicapped."" He notes that eliminating disability labels does not mean that students would lose their rights or access to services under the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).

Critics argue that the plan is a ruse to save money, as state and federal aid are tied to the number of students classified as handicapped. However, Dr. Osowski counters that the plan would actually serve more students effectively without labeling them.

The article also mentions pilot schools in New Jersey that have implemented the new system and reports positive feedback from teachers and administrators. While some critics have expressed concerns about the plan's potential impact on students with more severe disabilities, Dr. Osowski emphasizes that the pilot is still ongoing, and final recommendations will not be made until next year.

The article highlights the benefits of this approach, including:

1. Eliminating stigma: By not labeling students as ""handicapped,"" the system aims to reduce stigma and promote inclusion.
2. Increased flexibility: The resource committee can provide services within regular education classes, allowing for more flexible support for students.
3. Cost savings: Pilot schools have reported no significant cost increases or decreases, suggesting that the new system is financially viable.

Overall, this article provides a balanced view of the pros and cons of the New Jersey Department of Education's plan to revise its special education system."

8909032,282861,"The Helms amendment is a controversial proposal that would restrict the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from funding projects that contain obscene or indecent material. Some members of Congress, including Representatives Rohrabacher and Yates, are opposed to the amendment, but fear that publicly voting against it could lead to attacks from conservatives.

Representative Rohrabacher is prepared to force a roll-call vote on the Helms amendment by moving to instruct the House conferees to agree to the unrelated amendment. He has lined up support from 22 national organizations representing conservative interests and plans to use parliamentary tactics to prevent debate from being terminated.

If Representative Rohrabacher succeeds in forcing a roll-call vote, his colleagues are aware of the risks involved in opposing him. In the past, similar attempts to limit funding for the NEA have been met with fierce opposition, and lawmakers who voted against such measures were targeted by conservative groups.

Representative Yates, a 14-year veteran of fighting off attempts to weaken the NEA, believes that Representative Rohrabacher's efforts will ultimately fail because the Helms amendment has been rejected in the past. However, Senator Helms, who originally proposed the amendment, is known for his ability to dramatize his position and may still manage to push it through.

The debate over the Helms amendment has sparked intense emotions on both sides of the issue, with rallies and letter-writing campaigns being staged by supporters and opponents alike. The outcome of this battle remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the controversy surrounding the NEA will continue to be a contentious issue in Congress for some time to come."

8912041,309074,"Here's the information about radiation exposure:

* In the early 1950s, workers at the Nevada Test Site were exposed to high levels of radiation, exceeding safety limits.
* The government's safety limit was 12 rems per year, which is more than twice the current limit of 5 rems per year. One rem is equivalent to seven or eight X-rays.
* A security guard named Eugene D. Haynes received a dose of at least 39 rems in 1955 after wandering into a contaminated zone near ground zero. He died of lung cancer in 1985 at the age of 66.
* In November 1955 and January 1956, four workers received radiation doses far exceeding the safety limit during experiments involving atomic bombs destroyed by conventional explosives.
* One worker, Oral B. Epley, died on February 1, 1956, of a brain hemmorhage at the age of 57. The government and private physicians initially concluded that radiation was not related to his death.
* In 1961, 108 miners were pulled out of two tunnels after it was determined that they had absorbed doses exceeding safety limits. They were offered beer to flush contaminants from their bodies.
* On June 6, 1963, 13 miners who had been clearing rubble from a deep tunnel were discovered to have been contaminated by radioactive iodine produced by an atomic test the previous day.

These incidents highlight the lack of attention to radiation safety at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s and early 1960s."

**Title:** ""Affirmative Action Program Re-examination and Related Cases""

**Objective:** To analyze and extract protest information from news articles related to affirmative action programs, National Guard mobilization, labor union duty, and libel judgments.

**Inputs:**

1. News article text (last year's Court declaration of an unconstitutional contracting program)
2. Case summaries for new cases (affirmative action program re-examination, National Guard mobilization, labor union duty, and libel judgment)

**Processing Steps:**

1. Tokenization: Break down the news article text into individual words or tokens.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify key entities such as people, organizations, and locations mentioned in the article.
3. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Determine the grammatical category of each token (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb).
4. Dependency Parsing: Analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence to identify relationships between tokens.
5. Case Analysis:
	* Affirmative Action Program Re-examination: Extract information on the commission's program and its impact on minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
	* National Guard Mobilization: Summarize the case involving Gov. Rudy Perpich's challenge to the Montgomery Amendment, including the constitutional dispute over the authority to mobilize state National Guard units.
	* Labor Union Duty: Outline the United Steelworkers v. Rawson case, which explores whether workers can sue their labor unions for negligence in failing to carry out safety provisions.
	* Libel Judgment: Extract details on the libel suit brought by FBI agent David Price against author Peter Mattheissen and publisher Viking Penguin Inc.

**Outputs:**

1. Protest information summaries for each case:
	* Affirmative Action Program Re-examination: The commission's program has increased minority ownership of broadcast outlets only slightly, with a few dozen license sales to minority-owned companies since 1978.
	* National Guard Mobilization: The Montgomery Amendment prohibits governors from withholding consent for mobilizing state National Guard units overseas, sparking a constitutional dispute over the authority of Congress to raise and support armies.
	* Labor Union Duty: Workers may sue their labor unions for negligence in failing to carry out safety provisions, but only if permitted by state courts.
	* Libel Judgment: The court dismissed FBI agent David Price's libel suit against author Peter Mattheissen and publisher Viking Penguin Inc., citing constitutional protections for opinion and neutral reportage.

9002017,325926,"This news article reports on the ordination of Robert Williams as an Episcopal priest by Bishop John Spong. The ceremony took place at All Saints Church and was attended by television cameras and reporters.

The article highlights that the ordination was met with opposition from a traditionalist group, the Episcopal Synod of America, who argued that it violated Holy Scripture and a 1979 convention resolution prohibiting the ordination of homosexuals to the priesthood. Bishop Spong maintained that the resolution was only advisory and that Williams had the gifts and talents necessary for a priestly ministry.

The article also mentions that Williams's partner, Mr. Skelly, marched in the procession during the ceremony.

After the ordination, Bishop Spong sent a 19-page report detailing the process by which he screened, interviewed, and tested Williams, stating that there was no question about his gifts and talents for priesthood. He wrote that Williams and Skelly loved each other and intended their relationship to be a lifelong union, marked by their willingness to live for each other.

The article also reports on a presentation given by Williams at a Detroit church, where he argued that monogamy is not essential for a valid Christian relationship and that sexual exclusivity is an option. He also stated that celibacy is ""an inherently negative phenomenon"" that contributes to the generally sex-negative attitude that has permeated culture and church.

The article concludes with Bishop Spong's disassociation from Williams's remarks and his order for Williams to cease functioning as a priest or speaking publicly, pending an investigation into whether fraud was committed during the screening process."

9003022,333629,"This article discusses the challenges and criticisms surrounding the use of Breathalyzer readings as evidence in drunken driving (DUI) cases in New Jersey. The main points are:

1. **Moore's criticism**: Defense attorney Robert Moore argues that the Breathalyzer is flawed and can be easily manipulated by police officers to produce a desired reading, which he calls ""dial-a-drunk.""
2. **Error margin**: Dr. Robert F. Borkenstein, inventor of the Breathalyzer, notes that there is an inherent error margin in converting breath vapor measurements into blood alcohol levels, which could result in inaccurate readings.
3. **Accuracy concerns**: Moore suggests that the accuracy of the Breathalyzer is compromised by the fact that officers are not required to record their observations or measurements accurately, making it difficult to determine whether the reading was accurate.
4. **Constitutionality**: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has challenged the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints, also known as ""D.W.I. roadblocks,"" arguing that they are unconstitutional without probable cause.
5. **Effectiveness**: While some officials argue that sobriety checkpoints are an effective deterrent to drunk driving, others suggest that roving patrols may be a more effective approach.

The article highlights the controversy surrounding the use of Breathalyzer readings as evidence in DUI cases and raises questions about the accuracy, reliability, and constitutionality of these measures."
9003019,333630,"Here is a summary of protest information extracted from the news article:

**Residents' Concerns:**

* Jet noise has been unbearable, with some residents reporting being awakened at 2-3 AM by air cargo flights.
* Planes occasionally fly so low that it's possible to read the airline's name on the fuselage.
* Noise is not only a disturbance but also affects property values and quality of life.
* Some residents have had to move away due to unbearable noise, while others are considering relocation.

**Coalition Demands:**

* Curfews for night flights
* Use of quieter aircraft or newer models
* Environmental impact studies before changes to flight routes

**Port Authority's Response:**

* Defends the current plan and claims it was made in good faith to offer relief to affected communities.
* Admits that some adjustments have been made, but critics argue these changes merely shifted the noise from one community to another.

**Aviation Agency's Response:**

* Claims that an environmental impact study was not necessary because the East Coast plan is for ""high altitude"" operations.
* Acknowledges the growth in air traffic since deregulation and the need to balance environmental concerns with expanded air traffic.
* Has reverted to pre-1987 flight patterns for night flights (11 PM - 7 AM) in some cases.

**Legislative Efforts:**

* A bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Maureen Ogden would require use of quieter aircraft; it lost by four votes last year but will be reintroduced this session.
* Bills have been introduced in Congress by Representatives Roukema and Courter.
* The coalition is pressing Governor Jim Florio to file a suit against the aviation agency."

9004060,347374,"This article reports on the impact of the end of the Cold War on a town in Connecticut that had been heavily reliant on military spending. The town, Montville, is home to a UNC Naval Products plant that builds nuclear reactors for submarines, and many residents commute to Electric Boat's submarine shipyard in nearby Groton.

The article states that UNC has laid off 166 of its 1,060 employees, with the next round of layoffs expected to occur on June 10. The company is facing significant challenges due to a Navy decision to cut production of its fast-attack submarines and a Department of Energy directive giving all future construction work on marine nuclear reactors to Babcock & Wilcox.

The article also mentions that Electric Boat has not lost any jobs, but notes that the company's director of communications says there are uncertainties ahead. However, the town is still feeling the economic impact of the layoffs, with many businesses experiencing a decline in customers and tax bases.

The article highlights the concerns of UNC employees, who feel that they have been left behind by the shift to non-defense industries. They are advocating for government aid to support the company's transition or to attract new industry to the area.

Some quotes from the article include:

* ""Things have been too good for too long."" - Wayne D. Scott, Montville's First Selectman
* ""We are going to have some tough times ahead."" - Mr. Scott
* ""The defense workers of America have paid the premiums of peace through their labor and efforts and dedication, but the peace dividend is going to be paid overseas... That dividend should be turned around and put back into the defense industry for retooling. It's only fair."" - James B. Rusiecki, a supervisor at UNC

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by communities that had been heavily reliant on military spending during the Cold War era, and the need for government support to help them transition to new industries."

9007040,370685,"The sentiment expressed by Mr. Sternlieb, a prominent figure in the Hands Across New Jersey protest group, is one of frustration and betrayal towards Governor Florio's tax program. He believes that the Governor's plan promises future benefits at the cost of present pain, which may not resonate with voters.

Residents' sense of betrayal stems from feeling that their concerns are not being heard or addressed by the Governor and state lawmakers. This perceived lack of representation is fuelling the protest movement, with many residents signing the petition to express their dissatisfaction with the tax program.

The poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University found that 80% of New Jersey residents surveyed were dissatisfied with Governor Florio's tax program, and only 23% believed he was doing a ""good"" or ""excellent"" job as Governor. These figures suggest that voters are largely opposed to the tax increase and feel that the Governor is not effectively communicating his plans.

The Hands Across New Jersey protest group's demands for immediate repeal of the tax increase, an independent audit of the state's financial condition, and a rollback of salary increases reflect their desire for change and accountability. While the petition has no binding effect, it serves as a symbol of residents' dissatisfaction with the Governor's program.

Overall, the sentiment expressed by Mr. Sternlieb and other protesters is one of frustration, betrayal, and a desire for change. The protest movement seeks to hold elected officials accountable for their actions and to bring attention to the concerns of New Jersey residents."

The article quotes Robert P. Burns, the lawyer for one of the defendants, Yusef Salaam, who denies that the case was racial and says it was about the relationship between police and minority communities. Burns also defends his decision to put Salaam on the stand, saying it forced the public to take a closer look at the case.

Other lawyers involved in the case, including Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, also weigh in on the verdict. Morgenthau says that the city is ill-served by those who seek to exploit the case for racial or political gain.

The article notes that the trial was marked by controversy and protests outside the courtroom, with some protesters accusing the victim of being promiscuous and others vilifying her boyfriend. The leader of one protest group, Rev. Al Sharpton, warns that the convictions will ""inflame the city.""

Overall, the article presents a nuanced picture of a complex and controversial trial, highlighting the tensions and emotions surrounding the case."

**Protest Topic:** Acquaintance rape on college campuses

**Key Issues:**

1. Colleges and universities are reluctant to address the problem of acquaintance rape.
2. Women in college are often reluctant to admit mistakes or report instances of acquaintance rape due to social pressure and fear of consequences.
3. Many colleges and universities lack sensitive treatment of the problem or clear avenues for women to pursue remedies.

**Protest Demands:**

1. Colleges and universities should provide education programs on acquaintance rape, requiring athletes and fraternity members to attend lectures on the subject.
2. Men's groups should be formed to discuss sexuality and produce videotapes about it.
3. Insurers may withdraw from the college market if the risk of insuring institutions becomes too great.

**Protest Strategies:**

1. Colleges and universities are introducing new education programs or strengthening existing ones on acquaintance rape.
2. Some colleges and universities are forming men-only discussion groups to talk about sexuality and producing videotapes about it.
3. Women's rights advocates are calling for greater awareness and education among college women about what constitutes forced sex between acquaintances or dates.

**Protest Outcomes:**

1. Several states and the Federal Government have passed laws requiring institutions to report crime statistics.
2. Insurance companies may withdraw from the college market if the risk of insuring institutions becomes too great.

Let me know if you would like me to extract any specific information or if you have any further requests!"
9101006,412518,"The article highlights the growing problem of acquaintance rape on college campuses, where victims often feel reluctant to report the incidents due to shame, fear, or lack of confidence in the reporting process.

Key findings and quotes from the article:

1. Men are more likely to assume that initial refusals from women are part of a ""mating game"" ritual, rather than genuine objections.
2. Women complain about men assuming certain behaviors, like kissing or heavy petting, are an automatic precursor to intercourse.
3. First-year students are particularly vulnerable to acquaintance rape due to their inexperience and lack of assertiveness.
4. Insurers may withdraw from the college market if the risk of insuring institutions becomes too great.
5. Universities and colleges are introducing new education programs or strengthening existing ones on acquaintance rape, requiring athletes and fraternity members to attend lectures on the subject.
6. Women need to be forceful and clear in their signals, both spoken and non-spoken, to avoid situations where they become vulnerable.

Quotes from the article:

* Claire Walsh, founder and director of the Sexual Assault Recovery Service at the University of Florida: ""There are still a lot of colleges reluctant to address the problem.""
* Amy Kantra, Lehigh University senior: ""You can say no, but the guy keeps going. Then the girl finds herself in a situation she doesn't know how to deal with.""
* Ms. Volchko, Lehigh University dean: ""It's very common... That's why it's so scary.""
* Lawrence K. Pettit, chancellor of Southern Illinois University: ""College-age kids nowadays have a different attitude toward sex. They regard it almost as an entitlement, certainly as an expectation.""

The article highlights the need for colleges and universities to take proactive steps in educating students about consent, healthy relationships, and reporting procedures."
9101085,412518,"This article discusses the issue of acquaintance rape on college campuses, specifically focusing on the role of men and women in perpetuating the problem. The article highlights that many men have been socialized to pursue women for sex and to translate a woman's ""no"" into meaning ""yes."" It also notes that many women are reluctant to admit mistakes or report instances of acquaintance rape due to fear of being judged or labeled.

The article quotes various university administrators, counselors, and students, who emphasize the need for education programs to raise awareness about acquaintance rape. They also stress the importance of creating a culture where men understand that ""no"" means ""no"" and women feel empowered to report instances of abuse.

Some specific points made in the article include:

1. Many colleges have been reluctant to address the issue of acquaintance rape, which has hindered reporting and created a culture of silence.
2. Insurance companies are increasingly concerned about the risk of campus crime, including acquaintance rape, and may withdraw from insuring certain institutions.
3. Men need to educate themselves about what is permissible in various situations, and women need to take responsibility for educating themselves about their own boundaries.
4. The socialization of men has been a significant factor in perpetuating the problem of acquaintance rape, with many young men being conditioned to pursue women for sex and to translate a woman's ""no"" into meaning ""yes.""
5. Women need to be forceful and clear in their signals, both spoken and non-spoken, to avoid situations where they become vulnerable.

Overall, the article highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing acquaintance rape on college campuses, including education programs, reporting mechanisms, and a culture shift towards respect for women's boundaries."
9101004,412626,"This article discusses a controversy between two departments at San Francisco State University: the Department of Political Science and the School of Ethnic Studies. The issue revolves around a course taught by Professor Smith in the Department of Political Science that explores black political experiences, which some perceive as duplicating a course already offered by Dr. T'Shaka in the School of Ethnic Studies.

The article highlights the differences between the two departments' approaches to teaching and learning. Dr. T'Shaka's course focuses on social and historical themes, tracing back to Africa, while Professor Smith's course concentrates on more contemporary issues after the Civil War. The controversy has led to concerns about the university's treatment of ethnic studies programs and the potential dilution of their content.

Key points from the article include:

1. The university initially ruled that the courses were duplicative but later reversed its decision, allowing Professor Smith's course to be offered by the political science department.
2. Dr. T'Shaka believes that the university has a two-tiered system, where rules for traditional departments differ from those for ethnic studies programs.
3. Some see this as an attempt to drain students from ethnic studies programs until they are small enough to be absorbed by traditional disciplines.
4. The president of San Francisco State and the vice president for academic affairs deny any opposition to the School of Ethnic Studies, stating that they will try to better coordinate course offerings to prevent future conflicts.
5. Professor Smith argues that his course gives legitimacy to black politics, while Dr. T'Shaka believes that folding ethnic studies courses into traditional departments would dilute their content and viewpoint.

The article also explores the broader context of non-European studies on American campuses over the past 20 years. It notes that many colleges and universities are now introducing courses that examine and reflect views from cultures other than European ones, as well as hiring more scholars from minorities. However, this trend has led to concerns about an academic tug-of-war between specialized departments like ethnic studies and their larger, more powerful traditional counterparts."

9101032,414957,"According to the article, tobacco companies are believed to be behind the sudden push for smokers' rights legislation. This is supported by the experience of Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of nursing who received a call from a Philip Morris employee asking her to support the legislation.

Philip Morris's director of communications, Les Zuke, confirmed that the company was providing an 800 number as a response to ""many New Jersey smokers who have contacted us asking how they can get involved in protecting their own rights.""

The article also highlights the concerns of employers who reject hiring smokers, citing rising health insurance costs and employee absenteeism. Some employers, such as Varityper Inc. and Fortunoff, have policies in place that refuse to hire smokers.

Opponents of the legislation argue that it is unnecessary to pass special laws for smokers and that employers have a right to prefer hiring nonsmokers. Experts on constitutional and civil rights issues agree, saying that making smoking a protected civil right is ""ludicrous"" and would prevent employers from taking steps to control rising health insurance costs and employee absenteeism.

The article also mentions the concerns of some state legislators who believe that the legislation sends a terrible message to young people and elevates smoking to the level of a protected right."

9102007,421074,"You're sharing opinions from various stakeholders on the issue of distributing condoms in schools to prevent AIDS/HIV transmission among students. The speakers are divided into two main groups: those who support condom distribution as a necessary measure to protect young people's health and well-being, and those who oppose it, arguing that it promotes promiscuity and undermines moral values.

Some notable quotes from the supporters of condom distribution include:

* Erica Zurer: ""The kind of power that condoms have is to protect against HIV infection and save lives. I think this is the most moral thing we could do.""
* Denis J. Butler: ""For the Board of Education to deny young people the knowledge and the methods of prevention that are at our disposal is not only harsh and callous, but it would be a criminal dereliction of duty.""
* Rose Merola: ""I will not rest until every student in the schools -- gay or straight, male or female, of whatever race or ethnicity -- enjoys that same confidence (of being safe from HIV transmission).""

On the other hand, some notable quotes from those who oppose condom distribution include:

* Helen O'Neill: ""Just the thought of it repulses me. It would be taking away her beauty, virtue and innocence.""
* Brother David Carroll: ""By allowing this proposal, our children will become nothing more than objects of illicit sex that degrades and kills their body and soul.""
* Alan Ettman: ""Condoms can't tear apart nuclear families or usurp parental influence. And they can't cause children to be promiscuous. They simply do not have that kind of power.""

Overall, the debate highlights the complexities and challenges surrounding the issue of condom distribution in schools. While some argue that it is a necessary measure for protecting students' health and well-being, others believe it promotes promiscuity and undermines moral values."

1. **Education**: There is a case about Mississippi's dual system of higher education, which maintains segregation in schools. The government brief argues that Mississippi has ""impermissibly fettered"" student choice by continuing this system.
2. **Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)**: The article mentions the White House Initiative on HBCUs, established through three Executive Orders since 1980. The initiative provides grants and loans to support these colleges. In the last fiscal year, over $800 million was awarded to HBCUs.
3. **Government Policy**: There is an unclear request from the government regarding the approach to eliminating segregation in higher education.

No specific protests or demonstrations are mentioned in this article. However, it appears that there may be ongoing issues related to racial segregation and inequality in education, as well as concerns about the government's policies on historically black colleges and universities."

**Railroad Strike:**

* The railroad strike has been ongoing since January 1st.
* The strike involves 235,000 workers from eight or nine unions.
* The main issues are:
	+ Number of people needed to run a train (unions say 4-5, management says 2).
	+ Distance a worker must travel to be credited for working a full day (currently 108 miles, but unions want to reduce it to 100 miles).

**Congress Involvement:**

* Congress has intervened in the negotiations, with some members feeling uncomfortable about their role.
* The negotiators agreed that one member of the new mediation board would come from the Presidential emergency board and the other two would be appointed by Mr. Bush from a list supplied by the National Mediation Board.

**Economic Impact:**

* Some businesses have stockpiled supplies, but others, such as the automobile industry, are not prepared.
* The coal industry is particularly vulnerable to disruptions, with 38% of rail freight tonnage being coal.
* General Motors estimates that 75-80% of its production will be affected within 24 hours.

**Commuter Impact:**

* Few commuters have been affected so far, except for those in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco areas.
* CalTrain services were shut down by Southern Pacific Transportation Company, but attempts are being made to restore most commuter service.

**Union Perspectives:**

* Union leaders are frustrated that the government is unwilling to let the strike run its course, hoping to force concessions on wages and working conditions.
* One union leader, Tom DuBose, believes that Congress should not intervene in collective bargaining."

* No specific protests or demonstrations mentioned in the article.
* However, the article highlights the increasing diversity and racial awareness among students at Berkeley, which may potentially lead to social changes.

Additional points:

* The article mentions that minority enrollment has increased significantly at Berkeley, with no single group making up a majority.
* Troy Duster, director of the Institute for the Study of Social Change at Berkeley, is conducting a study on campus diversity and has found that racial awareness has intensified as minority enrollment has risen.
* Dr. Duster's study suggests that campus fragmentation may lead to social transformation, where students learn to appreciate and understand each other's cultures.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of the complexities surrounding cultural diversity and racial awareness among students at Berkeley, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for social change."

9107014,458452,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding the chemical Alar, which was used in apple orchards to control pests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned Alar due to concerns that it posed a cancer risk to children. However, many farmers and growers argue that the ban was based on flawed science and has had devastating effects on their livelihoods.

The article quotes Jim Clements, a farmer from Washington state who has lost millions of dollars in revenue as a result of the Alar ban. He says that the panic over Alar broke a bond of trust between farmers and consumers, and that many innocent people were hurt by the misinformation spread about the chemical.

The article also mentions the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which released a study claiming that Alar posed a significant risk to children's health. The NRDC hired a public relations firm to promote their findings, which led to widespread media coverage and public outcry. However, many scientists have criticized the NRDC's methodology and conclusions.

The article notes that two reviews of the Alar findings - one by Britain's Advisory Committee on Pesticides and another by the California Department of Food and Agriculture - have concluded that the cancer risk from Alar was minuscule. Despite this, the controversy over Alar has had lasting effects on the apple industry, with many farmers continuing to feel the economic impacts of the ban.

The article also mentions a lawsuit filed against CBS News and other defendants by a group of apple growers who claim that their reputations were damaged by the ""60 Minutes"" broadcast on Alar. The lawsuit is ongoing and may take years to come to trial."

The incident has sparked widespread outrage and protests from the community, with many calling for fundamental changes to the police department's practices.

The article highlights Chief Philip Arreola's efforts to rebuild confidence between the police department and the community, including his attempts to develop a more community-oriented policing style. However, critics argue that these efforts have been hindered by the department's historical problems, including a reputation for being hostile towards minority groups.

The case has also drawn attention to long-standing issues faced by Milwaukee's gay community, who claim that they have been subject to harassment and assault by police officers. Protests have been held in response to the incident, with many calling for increased accountability and transparency from the police department.

Not everyone is opposed to the police, however. Some residents offer words of encouragement and support for the officers, acknowledging that policing can be a challenging job.

The article also notes that Chief Arreola has suspended the three officers involved in the case, but refuses to disclose what charges they are facing. The police union has responded by calling for a vote of confidence in the chief's leadership, which could potentially lead to his resignation.

Overall, this news article suggests that the tensions between the community and the police department in Milwaukee are complex and multifaceted, with many historical issues still needing to be addressed in order to rebuild trust."

The incident began when a Hasidic Jew was involved in a car accident while returning from his wife's grave at Montefiore Cemetery. The driver of the car and his passengers were attacked by an angry crowd of blacks who had gathered at the scene. The police responded to the incident, but not before two men were stabbed, one of whom died later that night.

The article reports that 14 people were arrested by 10 pm, including a television journalist who was attacked while covering the story. At least a dozen police officers were injured in the violence, including one who was struck in the face with a bottle and left bleeding profusely.

The incident highlighted long-standing tensions between the black and Jewish communities in Crown Heights. The article quotes Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch as saying that there is ""years and years of tension"" in the area and that the police have been accused of favoring the Hasidic community over other residents.

The violence was widely condemned, with Mayor David Dinkins calling it ""painful."" The incident also led to renewed calls for greater understanding and cooperation between the black and Jewish communities."

1. **Los Alamos process**: Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory are developing a method to safely destroy solid-rocket fuel using oxidation. The process has shown promise, but it's still in the early stages.
2. **Air Force funding**: The Air Force is financing the research to explore innovative ways to recycle or destroy missiles, including the Los Alamos process.
3. **Missile destruction in Iraq**: Following the Gulf War, the United Nations conducted a police action to destroy Iraqi missiles with a range of more than 93 miles. The primary method used was pulverization with a heavy weight.
4. **Start treaty**: The treaty requires the destruction of missile silos, submarines, and bombers, but allows for the reuse of missiles under strict guidelines. This has raised questions about what to do with retired American missiles, such as Minuteman 2's and Poseidon C-3's.
5. **Conversion to civil launchers**: Some experts suggest converting retired missiles into civil and commercial launchers that can loft small payloads into space. However, this idea is met with concerns from the private launching industry about competition and the potential for government-subsidized launchers to flood the market.

No protests or social unrest are mentioned in this article. The focus is on the scientific and technological aspects of missile destruction and recycling."

**Protest Details**

* **Union Affiliation**: The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) represents workers at another Korean-language daily in Manhattan, The Chosun Daily News.
* **Reason for Protest**: Mass dismissals at The Sae Gae Times, a Korean-language newspaper, following an organizing campaign by union members.
* **Number of Dismissed Workers**: 17 people were dismissed on May 31, with 15 being reporters and editors who had signed union cards.
* **Allegations**: Union leaders claim that the dismissals are a result of union activity, as management cited financial difficulties and computerization of operations as reasons for the layoffs.
* **Legal Action**: The ILGWU filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that the newspaper violated labor laws by discharging employees for union activity.
* **Potential Outcomes**:
	+ Administrative law judge's ruling can be appealed to the NLRB and then to federal courts, which could take 2-5 years.
	+ The ILGWU is considering a request from the garment workers' union for an injunction against The Sae Gae Times, ordering the newspaper to rehire dismissed workers while the dispute is resolved.

**Background**

* The protest began with a minor personal spat between two editors at the newspaper, which escalated into a broader conflict involving union membership and job security.
* Union leaders contend that management's actions were aimed at undercutting the recruitment effort and intimidating employees who support the union."

1. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has launched a community policing program aimed at improving relationships between police and communities.
2. The program involves three police vans called Neighborhood Resource Centers, which will provide resources and services to residents dealing with social problems like drug abuse and family violence.
3. The vans are staffed by police officers, representatives from other city agencies, and volunteers who aim to help residents access services that improve their quality of life.
4. The program also includes a radio public-service campaign and an award for ""Citizen of the Month"" to recognize residents who work with the police to tackle neighborhood problems.
5. Community policing is seen as a way to change the NYPD's image from being seen as hard-nosed police officers to being viewed as a positive force in communities.
6. Some police officers may be resistant to the community policing approach, particularly those who are ""macho"" and see the police as primarily a paramilitary operation.
7. However, others believe that community policing is an effective way to defuse crime and improve relationships between police and communities.
8. An example of this approach in action was provided by Officer Thomas Collins, who saved 25 weddings on Staten Island when a bridal shop suddenly closed without notice. He calmed angry customers and persuaded employees to open the business for the brides.

Overall, the article suggests that community policing is a key component of the NYPD's efforts to improve relationships between police and communities, and that it may require a shift in mindset among some police officers."

* Chief Pastore was reassigned to the animal shelter after 21 years of service, despite earning a pension.
* He earned the enmity of many officers by ejecting them from desk jobs to street duty, leading some to quit.
* The Chief started an unusual operation where he met with someone described as an informant on Mafia activities in secret meetings at a Holiday Inn.
* This operation cost thousands of dollars and was never made public.
* The Chief has been critical of traditional policing methods, advocating for community policing and ""service-oriented"" officers.
* He has also been pushing for changes such as sending first-time drug offenders to treatment instead of jail and reducing police presence in neighborhoods.

Overall, the article suggests that Chief Pastore is a maverick who is willing to challenge traditional norms and approaches to achieve his goals. While some may question his methods, he seems to have earned the respect of at least some members of the community."

9111038,487815,"This article reports on the murders of two gay men, Julio Rivera and Daniel Doyle, who were both found dead with signs of trauma and bludgeoning. The police initially considered the crime to be drug-related, but later recategorized it as a bias incident after months of protests by gay groups.

Julio Rivera was a 28-year-old Latino man who grew up in the South Bronx. He dropped out of school in the seventh grade and moved to Manhattan, where he met wealthy older men who introduced him to the theater, fine food and wine, designer clothes, cocaine, and the club scene. Despite his tough exterior, Rivera had a soft spot for extravagant gestures and was loved by those close to him.

Daniel Doyle, on the other hand, was a 23-year-old white man who grew up in a middle-class family with doting parents and two sisters. He attended prep school and college, studying Greek, Roman, and modern European literature. Despite his preppy image, Doyle was considered ""very smart, very sweet, very committed to his work"" by those who knew him.

Both men were found dead in their homes, with signs of trauma and bludgeoning. The police investigation initially focused on drug use as the cause of death, but later determined that the crimes were bias-related after months of protests from gay groups.

The article highlights the different backgrounds and experiences of the two men, but also notes their shared struggles with self-acceptance and identity. It suggests that the murders may have been motivated by a desire to erase these individuals' identities and experiences."

9112001,490681,"Based on the article, it appears that the case before the Supreme Court involves a challenge to the St. Paul hate-crime ordinance, specifically its provision criminalizing cross-burning and swastikas. The law provides that anyone who places a symbol or object that arouses anger, alarm, or resentment in others based on race, color, religion, or gender commits disorderly conduct.

The article suggests that the Supreme Court may issue a narrow ruling, potentially only addressing the issue of whether the law can be used to challenge a criminal statute that discourages free speech. The main question is whether the ordinance's language is too broad and vague, allowing for the criminalization of other symbols or expressions that might offend someone.

The article also highlights the arguments presented by both sides. On one hand, Robert Viktora's lawyer, Edward J. Cleary, emphasizes that the law is overly broad and could lead to the criminalization of protected speech. He argues that the law targets specific ideas rather than actual harm caused by those ideas. On the other hand, Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley believes that the state Supreme Court has already narrowed the ordinance enough to resolve First Amendment concerns. He argues that the law specifically targets hate crimes and that burning a cross in someone's yard is different from protected speech.

The article also mentions the concerns of civil libertarians, who worry that the law could be used to suppress artistic expression or other forms of free speech. They argue that the ordinance is too vague and open-ended, allowing for the criminalization of almost any symbol or idea that might offend someone."

9112036,493523,"The article discusses the issue of waste management in New York City, specifically the city's reliance on incinerators and its lackluster recycling program. The city produces over 27,000 tons of refuse daily, and has not built a new garbage-burning plant in 30 years. Most of the commercial waste is sent to out-of-state landfills.

The article highlights the challenges faced by New York City's recycling program, which accounts for less than 6% of its waste. The city's administration has been criticized for not doing enough to promote recycling and for considering new incinerators despite the lack of success with the current program.

Advocates for increased recycling argue that if the city focused on developing markets for recycled waste, it would reduce the need for incinerators. However, opponents of incineration point out that they are necessary for managing the large volume of waste generated by the city.

The article also discusses the risks associated with incineration, including the potential for air pollution and health concerns. Despite these risks, many experts believe that incineration is a necessary step towards reducing waste in the city.

Some quotes from the article:

* ""Incineration should be the last resort, not the first."" - Eric A. Goldstein, senior attorney with the National Resources Defense Council
* ""It is one thing to have legitimate objections, as many do. But there are also those that take advantage of the fear. They have a political stake in creating hysteria."" - Paul Casowitz, former Deputy Sanitation Commissioner under Mayor Koch

Overall, the article highlights the complex issue of waste management in New York City and the need for a comprehensive approach that balances recycling with incineration."

9204010,520084,"The article discusses how Cracker Barrel, a popular restaurant chain, has been accused of discriminating against gay employees. Two employees, Samuel E. Hare and George Frisbee, were terminated from their jobs after the company discovered they were gay.

According to the article, both employees were given termination notices stating that they were being let go due to their sexual orientation. However, both men claimed that they had been invited to reapply for their positions multiple times only to be rejected again.

The article also mentions that Cracker Barrel's chairman, Dan W. Evins, has stated that the company is an equal opportunity employer and hires and promotes employees solely based on their qualifications and performance. However, gay advocacy groups argue that this statement is misleading since federal civil rights law does not protect homosexuals from workplace discrimination.

The article notes that Cracker Barrel has refused to comment on the issue, but that the company's growth has not been affected by the controversy. In fact, the company's sales have increased despite the negative publicity.

Some customers of Cracker Barrel have expressed support for the company's stance on homosexuality, citing religious beliefs as a reason for their opposition. However, gay advocacy groups argue that discrimination against gay employees is unacceptable and that legislation is needed to protect them from workplace discrimination.

Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend federal civil rights protection to homosexuals, but it is unlikely to be enacted anytime soon."

9204030,523394,"This news article reports on a court case involving Planned Parenthood and a group of abortion clinics challenging a Pennsylvania law restricting abortion rights. The article provides a detailed account of the oral arguments presented by the lawyers involved, including Ms. Kolbert, who represented Planned Parenthood and argued that the Court should continue to apply the strict scrutiny standard established in Roe v. Wade.

The article highlights the lively debate among the justices, with Justice Kennedy taking issue with Ms. Kolbert's assertion that the only logical possibility is to uphold the law under a stricter standard. The Solicitor General Starr urged the Court to adopt a rational basis test for abortion, which would allow restrictions on the exercise of a fundamental right to be upheld if they serve a ""legitimate"" state interest.

The article also notes the concerns expressed by Justice O'Connor regarding the notification provision requiring married women to notify their husbands of their intention to get an abortion. The Attorney General, Mr. Preate, struggled to defend this provision, acknowledging that it would require notification to all fathers and potentially even to anyone with whom a woman had intercourse.

Overall, the article provides insight into the legal arguments presented in the case and highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding abortion rights in the United States."
9204036,523742,"A protest article! Here are the protests' details:

**Protest Name:** ""Spring of Life""

**Location:** Buffalo, New York

**Organizers:** Operation Rescue and Pro-Choice Network (B.U.C.)

**Dates:** April 20 (announced) to present

**Participating Groups:** Operation Rescue, Pro-Choice Network (B.U.C.), and others

**Numbers:** Up to 100 cars in a convoy heading into the city; around 50-100 clinic defenders gathered outside clinics

**Tactics:**

* Operation Rescue protesters aim to chain themselves in front of clinics to jam entrances
* Pro-choice supporters shout anti-Nazism slogans and call protesters fascists
* Both sides have site leaders, quadrant leaders, and coordinators refining tactics and moving volunteers

**Key Moments:**

* Rev. Joseph Slovenec, an Operation Rescue regional leader, is surrounded by abortion rights advocates on early protests; he solves this problem by using two cell phones (one in each ear) to stay connected
* Pro-choice supporters offer clinics help during Operation Rescue's Wichita protests last summer; Kansas clinics prefer police handling crisis alone

**Background:**

* Operation Rescue has been planning for three years, with a strong pro-life political base and Catholic support
* The organization grew out of a 36-hour prayer meeting in Binghamton (1987) and started protesting at the Democratic Convention in Atlanta (1988)
* Pro-choice supporters formed Buffalo United for Choice (B.U.C.) to counter Operation Rescue's protests

**Personal Stories:**

* Lucille VanZandt, a former abortion patient, now with Operation Rescue, prays outside clinics

9206042,538544,"It seems that you'd like me to focus on the pre-1966 liability issue in the Cipollone case, which was not addressed by the Supreme Court today.

To clarify, the pre-1966 liability issue refers to the question of whether cigarette companies can be held liable for pre-1966 smoking-related injuries and deaths. This is an important aspect of the case because it would have significant implications for the tobacco industry's potential liability for past harm caused by their products.

The lawyer representing the Cipollone family, Marc Z. Edell, stated that at the new trial, he will introduce evidence demonstrating that the cigarette companies conspired to mislead the public and falsely advertise. This suggests that the focus of the trial will be on the companies' actions prior to 1966 and how they contributed to the harm caused to smokers.

It's worth noting that Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard law professor who argued the family's appeal in the Supreme Court, expects the new trial to be successful. He believes that the majority opinion today created a favorable climate for plaintiffs not only in smoking cases but also in suits for damages from other products with warning labels.

The pre-emption question is complex and has led to inconsistent rulings within this term alone. The fact that there was no single majority opinion underscores the division among justices on this issue.

Would you like me to provide more information or clarify any specific points regarding the pre-1966 liability issue in the Cipollone case?"

* The measure aims to amend the state constitution to require that all governments discourage homosexuality and other listed ""behaviors"" (pedophilia, sadism or masochism).
* If passed, opponents say it could lead to a witch hunt-style investigation to root out people who speak favorably of homosexuals in state and local government.
* The measure would allow discrimination against homosexuals, giving landlords the right to evict gay tenants and employers the right to dismiss gay employees.
* Legal scholars argue that the measure poses a clear violation of constitutional protections of free speech.
* Some opponents compare it to thought police and peeping Toms crawling all over Oregon looking for homosexuals.
* Many legal experts agree that the measure is censorship, guilt-by-association, and against the First Amendment.
* The measure has received opposition from most of Oregon's political establishment, major newspapers, and religious organizations.

Overall, Ballot Measure 9 is a controversial proposal that has sparked heated debate about issues such as free speech, discrimination, and intolerance."

* Some professors are frustrated with Dr. Gordon's attempts to radically alter the direction of the department, but he has the support of only a few tenured and nontenured professors.
* The controversy has led to a sense of chaos in the department, with some professors refusing to speak publicly about the matter.
* The Black Studies department is small, with only about a dozen students majoring in the field, but it offers 25 courses that are popular among students.
* Dr. Jeffries, the former chairman, is known for his provocative statements and has been involved in controversies surrounding race and culture.

**Protesters:** 23-year-old black senior and organizer of recent demonstrations at Old Westbury College.

**Reason for Protest:** Frustration over conditions at the college, including lack of student center, few campus activities, limited phone service in dorms, and cuts to basic education programs. Minority students feel unwelcome and isolated on campus.

**Quotes:**

* ""It makes us feel like they don't want us here."" - Organizer of the demonstrations
* ""I never thought I could go to college... This one woman really touched me. She said she'd be here for me, and that's been true."" - Cheryl Ware, 20-year-old junior from Hollis, Queens
* ""I come from a household where people speak Spanish all the time and it can be hard to shift to English. I was counting on that extra help."" - Brenda Cordero, 19-year-old freshman from the South Bronx

**Background:**

* Old Westbury College has a history of student protests and activism, dating back to its founding in 1968.
* The college's mission is universal access to education and outreach to minority students who have been traditionally bypassed by colleges.

9303049,598222,"Here is the protest information extracted from the news article:

**Issue:** Bilingual education and its role in promoting cultural identity and language preservation among Hispanic students, particularly Puerto Rican immigrants.

**Conflict:** The expectation that Hispanic students must give up their native language (Spanish) to become part of American society, which conflicts with their cultural identity and the desire to preserve their native language.

**Groups involved:**

1. **Puerto Rican community:** Advocates for bilingual education and preserving Spanish as a vital part of their cultural identity.
2. **Critics of bilingual education:** Argue that bilingual education is not an effective way to promote English acquisition and that it creates separate classrooms, perpetuating segregation.
3. **Educators:** Hernan Lafontaine, former Superintendent of Schools in Hartford, argues that people's reactions change depending on the language they hear (German vs. Spanish).
4. **Lawyers and advocates:**

a. William M. Ortiz, executive director of the San Juan Center, emphasizes the importance of preserving cultural identity.
b. Peter Roos, a lawyer with Multicultural Education Training and Advocacy, highlights the need for support from school administrators to make bilingual education programs successful.

**Key quotes:**

1. ""The message is, 'You need to give this up to be part of my society,'... And I say, Why? I speak Spanish and English. I own my home. My children are doing well in school."" - William M. Ortiz
2. ""If people hear me speak German, they will look at me and say, 'Look at that cultured man.' If I say the same thing in Spanish, they will say, 'Look at that Puerto Rican.'"" - Hernan Lafontaine

**Key statistics:**

1. 30 percent unemployment continues to drive north those who are least successful at home (referring to Puerto Ricans in Hartford).
2. Studies suggest that Hispanic people across the country take an extra generation to make the transition to English, in part because the migration keeps Spanish alive in their neighborhoods.
3. 45 percent of surveyed Puerto Rican parents said they would move or resort to private schools if their children were reassigned by a desegregation plan."

9306028,618365,"This news article discusses the intersectional issues faced by Black individuals who are also gay or lesbian. Many Black people have historically been unsympathetic to the plight of gay people, especially white gay men who hide their sexual orientation when it is advantageous for them. Some Blacks view homosexuality as morally wrong and see the gay rights movement as an attempt to gain recognition and acceptance.

The article highlights the views of various individuals, including Reverend Lester James, pastor of Zion Hill Baptist Church in Washington, who believes that God loves individual homosexuals but hates their lifestyle. Others, like Vernetta Adams, a 24-year-old history major at the University of the District of Columbia, argue that gay people hid their sexuality when it was advantageous and are now demanding rights.

The article also explores the views of Black civil rights leaders, such as Reverend Jesse Jackson, who have spoken out in support of gay rights. Some Blacks see this support as an attempt to gain empathy from white people who feel guilty about treating Blacks unfairly.

Caught in the middle of this debate are Black gay individuals, who recognize that there is racism within the gay community itself. They also face discrimination and prejudice from both Black and white society.

Despite these challenges, many Blacks support guarantees of equal rights for gay people, recognizing that the struggles faced by gay individuals are not unlike those faced by Blacks during the Civil Rights Movement. As stated in the article, ""To a large degree we are bound together by our opponents. Those who hate blacks hate gay people, hate Jews and abuse women, and fighting on behalf of any of us will ultimately lead to the liberation of all of us."""

9401001,659306,"This news article reports on a unique approach to addressing racist views and hate crimes among teenagers from the Fourth Reich Skinheads of Orange County. The program, developed with the help of various organizations and individuals, aimed to confront and potentially change the beliefs of these young people.

The article highlights several key moments in the program, including:

1. A visit to a Federal courtroom where a judge suggests that some of the participants may meet again under different circumstances.
2. Lunch at the Los Angeles County jail with inmates serving life sentences for murder, which had a profound impact on many of the youths.
3. Therapy sessions with counselors and teenagers from different ethnic groups, where they exchanged views and perspectives.
4. A screening of ""Schindler's List,"" a movie about a German businessman who saved the lives of over 1,000 Jews during World War II.
5. Sessions with local rabbis, members of the church, and Holocaust survivors, including Si Frumkin, who shared his experiences at Dachau concentration camp.

The article notes that some participants became testy during these sessions, expressing discomfort with certain labels and suggestions that they were being judged or labeled. However, many others were moved by the stories and perspectives shared by the Holocaust survivors, including Renee Firestone, an Auschwitz survivor who emphasized the importance of overcoming hatred and anger to raise children with love in their hearts.

The article concludes by quoting program leader Michael Greenberg, who reflected on the experience and expressed hope that it might provide a new alternative for these young people. He emphasized that people are either part of society or they prey on society, and that this program aimed to encourage participation rather than preying on others.

Overall, the article presents a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities involved in addressing hate crimes and racism among teenagers, highlighting both the challenges and potential benefits of such an approach."

9408001,703378,"The article discusses the issues of racism, intolerance, and bigotry in Cobb County, Georgia, particularly with regards to the treatment of African Americans and the LGBTQ+ community. The county has been criticized for its discriminatory practices, including:

1. Refusal to join the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and re-establish a rail link, which disproportionately affects African Americans.
2. Discriminatory housing practices, with two-thirds of black applicants receiving different information or treatment compared to white applicants.
3. Intolerance towards LGBTQ+ individuals, including the adoption of an anti-gay resolution that was met with widespread criticism.

The article also highlights the presence of extremist groups in Cobb County, including white supremacists and anti-Semites. The author notes that these groups are not representative of the majority of residents, but their influence can be significant.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""If it was still legal to pass a referendum against black folks, Cobb County might do it."" - Joe Shifalo, executive director of Metro Fair Housing
* ""I find that criticism to be almost amusing. Somehow you are criticizing someone for not wanting to have their kids' lunch money extorted in their school. Somehow they're selfish because they don't want to be mugged when they go out for a walk with their dog."" - Whit Ayers, Republican poll taker and political consultant
* ""It makes us look like a bunch of bigoted jackasses. It just startles me, and it upsets me tremendously."" - Tucker McQueen, resident

The article suggests that the growth of Cobb County is driven by people seeking a more conservative lifestyle, which can lead to intolerance and bigotry. The author notes that while some residents are horrified by the political uproar over the anti-gay resolution, others see it as a reflection of their values.

Overall, the article highlights the need for greater understanding and tolerance in Cobb County, particularly with regards to issues affecting African Americans and LGBTQ+ individuals."

The survey results mentioned in the article show that a majority of visitors to Yellowstone favor bringing back the wolf, while ranchers and other stakeholders have raised concerns about potential impacts on their livestock.

The article highlights the symbolic significance of restoring the wolf to its natural habitat, as well as the potential economic benefits for the local community through increased tourism. However, it also notes that the issue has become politicized, with various interest groups vying for influence.

Some ranchers are concerned about the potential loss of livestock and the lack of compensation from environmental organizations, while others see the wolf's presence as a way to increase property values and attract tourists. The article concludes by noting that the issue is not just about science or economics, but also about values and culture.

Overall, the article presents a balanced view of the debate surrounding wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park, highlighting both the potential benefits and concerns associated with this effort."

9412092,731835,"The article discusses the challenges faced by those relying on shelters and soup kitchens for survival in Connecticut during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The state's General Assistance program, which provided financial assistance to low-income individuals, was shifted from local municipalities to the state, leading to concerns about the impact on poor cities and towns.

The article highlights the struggles faced by welfare recipients, including:

1. Deterioration in overall health and ability due to reliance on shelters and soup kitchens.
2. Rising unemployment rates, leading to increased demands for General Assistance.
3. Concerns among local welfare directors that the state may not be able to properly address clients' needs.

The article also mentions two pilot programs aimed at promoting self-sufficiency among welfare recipients:

1. Pathways: A 2-year program providing education and training, as well as child care services, to help individuals become independent.
2. Family Strength: An increase in the asset limit for A.F.D.C. clients (from $1,000 to $3,000) and expanded eligibility for families with both parents in the home.

The article quotes welfare officials emphasizing the importance of changing the culture around General Assistance, from simply providing financial assistance to promoting self-sufficiency through education, job training, and employment opportunities.

Notable statistics mentioned in the article include:

1. 12,400 people on General Assistance in Connecticut in 1988-89.
2. The number rose to approximately 32,600 by 1991-92 due to increased unemployment.
3. 60% of the 750 welfare clients cut from Bridgeport's rolls last April (approximately 450 people) are back on welfare for various reasons.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities and challenges faced by those relying on public assistance in Connecticut during this period, as well as efforts to promote self-sufficiency and employment opportunities."

The article also touches on the biases towards or against landlords and tenants, as well as the challenges faced by judges in mediating these disputes.

Some key points from the article include:

1. A tenant who subsisted on Social Security was given a 72-hour eviction notice after falling behind on rent due to hospitalization.
2. Landlords' lawyers often use tactics like intimidation and manipulation to get tenants to sign stipulations, which can lead to lengthy court battles.
3. Housing court judges are tasked with mediating disputes between landlords and tenants, but may be biased towards one side or the other.
4. The system is designed to favor landlords, making it difficult for tenants to receive repairs and maintenance on their properties.
5. Tenants who become familiar with the court's legal processes can use this knowledge to delay evictions for years, while landlords face significant losses in rent and legal fees.

Overall, this article highlights the complexities and challenges of New York City's housing courts, where tenants and landlords navigate a system that is often biased towards one side or the other."

9502018,742611,"The protest information extracted from the news article is:

* Hurt Al Tatum, a 6 feet 4 inches tall African American man, filed an accusation of racial harassment against his employer, Cooper Power.
* Tatum worked at Cooper Power for four years before leaving due to the constant racial harassment and stress caused by his co-workers' slurs, epithets, and jokes.
* The harassment included finding a fake ""Application Form for Mike McGee's Militia"" on his desk with racist and derogatory language.
* Despite repeated complaints to supervisors and investigators, Tatum's situation did not improve until he was sent on the road for six months, where he continued to face racism.
* The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) took 3 years to investigate Tatum's case, during which time his mental health deteriorated due to stress and anxiety caused by the ongoing harassment.
* In February 1994, the EEOC finally found ""reasonable cause"" to believe that Cooper Power had violated Tatum's civil rights, and invited him to participate in a settlement process or prepare for a day in court.

The protest information highlights issues of:

* Racial harassment in the workplace
* Delayed justice and lack of accountability by institutions like the EEOC
* Long-term effects on mental health and well-being caused by stress and anxiety related to racism."

* The case is about Iris Pyne, who killed her husband Richard in 1993.
* Mrs. Pyne had obtained three orders of protection against her husband since 1988, citing abuse and threats of violence.
* Mr. Pyne's brother, Bill Pyne, recalled that his brother offered to divorce Mrs. Pyne twice, but she refused both times.
* The article suggests that Mrs. Pyne's claim of self-defense was disputed by the prosecution's expert witness, Dr. Michael Baden.
* Despite Mr. Tendy's confidence in discrediting Dr. Baden, he chose not to call a single defense witness, and the jury ultimately found Mrs. Pyne guilty.
* The article raises questions about whether Mrs. Pyne was a battered wife and whether her actions were justified.

* Merco arranged to buy the land for $4.5 million and paid $20,000 to a title company owned by County Judge Billy Love.
* The payment was criticized as a bribe, but Merco claims it had no choice due to the county having only one title company.
* The project has been met with opposition from local residents, including the Sierra Blancans, who have expressed concerns about environmental and health impacts.
* The Hudspeth County Commission sued to stop the project, but Merco filed a countersuit and the commission eventually backed down.
* Residents have divided loyalties between two general stores in town based on their stance on the project.
* The E.P.A. has been criticized for its handling of the case, with Assistant Director Hugh B. Kaufman calling for a special prosecutor to investigate.
* Merco has been accused of having ties to organized crime and making payments to the Lucchese crime family.
* The company has also been criticized for trying to cultivate relationships with Texas politicians, including a donation to Governor Ann Richards' campaign.
* Local residents have expressed concerns about the environmental impact of the project, including the potential for contamination of water supplies.

Overall, the protests in this case are centered around concerns about environmental and health impacts, as well as perceived corruption and cronyism."

9509045,786659,"The article discusses the challenges faced by Chief Willie Williams, a black police chief who was appointed to lead the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) after years of controversy and allegations of racism. Despite efforts to reform the department, many black officers felt frustrated and alienated by the lack of support from leadership and the prevalence of racist attitudes among some white officers.

The article highlights several incidents that illustrate the problems faced by Chief Williams and his efforts to address them. These include:

* White officers resisting Chief Williams' appointment and attempting to undermine his authority
* Black officers being intimidated or harassed by their white colleagues, leading to a lack of complaints and reluctance to speak out against racism
* The lack of discipline for rogue officers, which perpetuates a culture of impunity
* Senior officers knowing about racist attitudes among some officers but not taking action to address them

The article also quotes several black officers who express frustration and disillusionment with the department's leadership. These include:

* Ronnie Catto, who compares racism in the LAPD to a cancer that needs to be addressed
* Bernard Parks, a deputy chief who argues that the department is being ""victimized by a stereotype"" about racism but acknowledges that discipline is an issue that can't be publicly discussed
* James Grant, who feels that Chief Williams' efforts to reform the department have been insufficient and that senior officers are aware of racist attitudes among some officers but don't take action to address them.

Overall, the article suggests that despite efforts to reform the LAPD, many black officers feel that the department's problems with racism and corruption remain unaddressed."

9511016,808176,"This news article reports on the ongoing strike at two major newspaper companies in Detroit, Knight-Ridder and Gannett. The strike has resulted in a significant decline in circulation, with both papers losing 24% of their combined daily circulation. The strike has also led to a decrease in advertising revenue, which is affecting the newspapers' bottom line.

The article quotes several individuals involved in the strike, including journalists who have been affected by the strike. One journalist, Molly Abraham, is quoted as saying that the unions have been weakened by journalists who have crossed picket lines and are now working for the companies. She believes that if the unions can be crushed in Detroit, they could be crushed anywhere.

Linda K. Foley, the national president of the Newspaper Guild, is quoted as saying that the two largest newspaper companies in the country have decided to bust their unions and that the strike is an attempt to prove that they cannot do so.

The article also quotes Hugh McDiarmid, a political columnist at The Free Press, who says that the strike has been a lesson in new business realities in the newspaper industry. He believes that both Knight-Ridder and Gannett are big companies that are concerned about their bottom line and are willing to take drastic measures to achieve their goals.

The article suggests that the strike may have long-term consequences for the newspapers, including a possible merger or cutbacks in resources devoted to news coverage. It also notes that the strike has had a significant human toll, with teamsters and pressmen who did not cross picket lines facing uncertainty about their future in the industry."

9511024,809090,"According to the article, colleges are getting little guidance from courts regarding how much each parent should pay for their child's education expenses after divorce. However, private colleges and universities generally follow the same rule, which is that both custodial and noncustodial parents have a moral obligation to contribute.

If a parent is involved in the child's life after divorce, they are expected to help pay college bills. Exceptions to this rule are rare, but if there is a history of abuse or long-term history of nonsupport and noninvolvement, the college may not expect contribution from that parent.

In practice, colleges have become more insistent on both parents contributing due to pragmatic reasons such as the need to stretch limited funds further. At private colleges, this means expecting both parents to contribute from their current income, savings, or assets, and for the student to use some savings or summer earnings. Public universities are less insistent, only expecting the custodial parent to help pay for college and making no effort to pursue the noncustodial parent.

The article also highlights a case where a father, Mr. Kline, had been estranged from his children after divorce but eventually reconciled with them and took on a greater role in supporting their education expenses."

The common thread among these cases is the presence of questionable evidence and potential police misconduct or errors that led to their convictions.

The article highlights the case of Paris Carriger, who was convicted of murdering a jewelry store owner in Phoenix, Arizona. However, new evidence has emerged that suggests Carriger's former prisonmate, Robert Dunbar, may have framed him for the crime. Despite this, Carriger has never confessed and has maintained his innocence from the start.

The article also mentions the case of Joseph R. O'Dell 3d, who is on death row in Virginia for a murder he allegedly committed in 1985. Supporters claim that DNA evidence shows he did not commit the crime, but the Virginia courts refused to permit him to introduce this new evidence at his trial.

Finally, the article discusses the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a radio journalist who was sentenced to death for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. Despite being cleared by the FBI, Abu-Jamal remains on death row due to ongoing legal battles and protests from supporters who claim he is innocent.

The common thread among these cases is the presence of questionable evidence, potential police misconduct or errors, and the need for further investigation and re-examination of the evidence presented at trial."
