Here's how I arrived at these answers:

* Code 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (the article mentions a $5,000 reward being offered in connection with the incident, which could be seen as an example of canvassing for information and support).

8701002,200,"This article appears to be a transcript of a meeting between New York City Mayor Edward Koch and a group of community leaders, activists, and politicians to discuss ways to ease racial tensions in the city following the Howard Beach incident.

Some notable quotes and statements include:

* Mayor Koch emphasized that the meeting was not meant to criticize Mr. Sandiford's lawyer, Mr. Maddox, or join in criticism of the victims' lawyers.
* Rev. Floyd H. Flake said there was no lynch-mob atmosphere at the meeting, but rather a positive and exemplary one.
* Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten stated that she would not try to pressure the lawyers and that she attended the meeting because she believes it is important for black leaders to be involved in discussions about black issues.
* Rev. Leo Hamilton expressed concern that Mayor Koch's initial criticism of Mr. Maddox may have created a negative impression, saying ""I have a great deal of respect for the Mayor, but he established a basis for evaluating this situation which almost seemed to throw the onus back on to blacks.""
* Some participants criticized Police Commissioner Ward's suggestion that Mr. Maddox was motivated by the potential financial gains from a civil suit.
* The group discussed the need to improve education and enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in housing, employment, and other areas to improve the racial climate in the city.
* Mayor Koch presented details on a new curriculum on race relations and tolerance that will be instituted within a few weeks in city schools.

Overall, this meeting appears to have been an attempt by Mayor Koch to bring together black leaders and activists to discuss ways to ease racial tensions in the city."

8701007,1694,"After reading the article, I extracted the following protest activities:

1. 18 ; 2. 97 ; 3. 21 ; 4. 31

Here's my reasoning:

* Activity 1: The article mentions a ""citywide boycott"" which fits category 18 (petitioning).
* Activity 2: The lack of clarity regarding whether other black leaders would support the action and how widespread it might be suggests that this activity is more related to legal maneuvers, such as lawsuits (category 97) rather than a specific protest tactic.
* Activity 3: There is no mention of specific protest tactics, but the article mentions ""cheers and applause"" during the community meeting, which could be related to category 21 (praying).
* Activity 4: The article discusses a ""day of mourning"" for Michael Griffith, which fits category 31 (worshipping)."

2. Speechmaking (Code 27): The article quotes several individuals, including Rev. Jesse Jackson, Dick Gregory, Coretta Scott King, Ed Stephens, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, making speeches or statements about the march and its goals.

8701013,7074,"This news article reports on a civil rights march that took place in Cumming, Georgia, which was met with resistance and hostility from white supremacists. The march was part of a ""brotherhood walk"" aimed at promoting racial understanding and integration in Forsyth County, which had a reputation for being hostile towards African Americans.

The march was attended by around 20,000 people, including prominent civil rights leaders such as Coretta Scott King, Jesse Jackson, and Andrew Young. However, the event was marred by violence and intimidation from white supremacists, who shouted racist slogans and waved Confederate flags.

Despite the presence of over 2,300 guardsmen and police officers, the situation became increasingly tense, with some marchers being attacked and others facing threats. At least 55 people were arrested or detained, including David E. Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader.

The article highlights the long history of racial tensions in Forsyth County, dating back to the early 20th century when African Americans were driven out of the area after a white woman accused three black men of rape and murder. The event was seen as a symbol of the deep-seated racism and intolerance that persisted in the county.

The article also quotes local residents who expressed shame and disgust at the events, but also fear for their own safety if they were to speak out against the racism. Overall, the march highlighted the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality in Forsyth County and beyond."

8702023,11356,"The article reports on a lawsuit filed by inmates at Cedar Junction prison against the state's Department of Corrections. The suit alleges that many inmates are kept in solitary confinement for more than a year, deprived of work and education programs, health services, and are endangered by the steel doors.

The lawsuit stems from the death of Jorge Camacho Bidot, who burned to death in his cell due to delayed rescue by guards. An investigation found that the guards were slow to respond because they didn't have access to an emergency lever, and that Bidot was denied psychiatric care and had his steel door always closed, violating prison rules.

The inmates are seeking relief from the court, including removing the steel doors, setting up a fire safety plan for the solitary confinement block, and releasing prisoners who were unjustly placed in solitary. The state has refused to comment on the case and related matters.

The lawsuit highlights several issues with the current system:

1. Lack of incentives to behave: Inmates are given projected release dates, which can range from 6 months to 10 years, effectively nullifying the purpose of solitary confinement.
2. Denial of work and education programs: Inmates in solitary are denied access to these programs, making it difficult for them to change their behavior and return to regular cells.
3. Lack of health services: Inmates in solitary are not receiving adequate healthcare, which can exacerbate mental health issues and other medical conditions.
4. Endangerment by steel doors: The steel doors pose a significant risk to inmates' safety, as demonstrated by Bidot's tragic death.

The lawsuit also highlights the lack of due process for inmates in solitary confinement. Witnesses testify that inmates are denied access to lawyers, witnesses, and evidence against them, making it difficult for them to contest their placement in solitary.

Overall, the lawsuit seeks to address the systemic issues with solitary confinement at Cedar Junction prison, including the denial of basic human rights and the lack of incentives to change behavior."

Here's how I arrived at these answers:

1. Activity: petitioning
Petitioning involves obtaining signatures and presenting petitions or letters. In this case, the black students stayed home to protest the school board's failure to name a black as assistant school superintendent, which is a clear call to action to change the decision.

2. Activity: holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing
The article states that 95 percent of the black students stayed home from school, implying a form of protest or demonstration, such as holding signs or participating in an informational picket line.

3. Activity: speechmaking
Speechmaking involves making speeches, testifying, witnessing, giving short talks, or delivering sermons. In this case, Rev. Michael Cathey is quoted as saying that the school board had ""reneged"" on a promise to appoint a black as assistant superintendent, which implies some form of public speaking.

4. Activity: other activity
The article doesn't specify any further activities beyond the students staying home from school and the quote from Rev. Michael Cathey."

8703001,17909,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding the use of salt on roads during winter months to prevent ice and snow from forming. While some argue that salt is necessary for safe driving, others claim that it poses environmental risks, such as contaminating drinking water supplies, harming roadside vegetation, and contributing to the corrosion of cars and bridges.

The article mentions two lawsuits pending in North Salem against the town, claiming that salt runoff from roads has polluted their private wells. In Bedford, a citizens group is advocating for the state to stop using salt exclusively on its roads, citing concerns about water pollution and environmental damage.

Some officials acknowledge the risks associated with salt use but argue that it is necessary for safe driving. For example, the State Department of Transportation claims that salt helps prevent accidents by keeping roads clear.

Others propose alternative solutions, such as using liquid calcium in combination with salt or studying specific roads to reduce or eliminate salt use altogether.

The article also notes that some towns have improved their storage facilities, and there are ongoing efforts to develop more environmentally friendly road maintenance practices."
8703002,17909,"Here are some key points extracted from the article:

1. **Salt runoff eliminated**: The town of North Salem has built permanent storage facilities to store hundreds of tons of salt, eliminating the salt runoff that occurred before when salt was stored outdoors under tarps.
2. **Public education needed**: Highway Superintendent Drew A. Outhouse emphasizes the need for public education to reduce salt use on roads, as drivers are reluctant to slow down during hazardous winter conditions.
3. **Lawsuits pending**: Two lawsuits have been filed against North Salem by residents who claim their drinking water supplies have been polluted by salt runoff from road maintenance.
4. **Concerns about environmental impact**: Opponents of excessive salt use point out the negative effects on the environment, including soil contamination and water pollution.
5. **Increased reimbursement for reduced salt use**: The county offers increased reimbursement to towns that reduce their salt usage, but participation is voluntary, and there are no hard figures indicating decreased salt use.
6. **No formal standards for salt in drinking water**: The State Health Department has guidelines for sodium levels in drinking water, but there are no formal standards for chloride levels or overall salt content.
7. **Studies underway to reduce or eliminate salt use**: The county is studying specific roads in North Salem to develop solutions for reducing or eliminating salt use, and liquid calcium may be used in combination with salt to make it more efficient.

These points highlight the ongoing concerns about the environmental impact of excessive salt use on road maintenance, as well as efforts to address these issues."

3. The article mentions that women had been included in the ritual here and in many other dioceses for years, implying a long-standing tradition of including women in this rite. This could be seen as a form of sloganeering/chanting (28) or speechmaking (27).
4. ""As protest over his decision swelled"" - This implies that there was a public display of opposition to Bishop Bevilacqua's decision, which could be seen as petitioning (18), gathering signatures and presenting petitions.

Please note that these answers are based on my interpretation of the article and may not reflect the actual activities or intentions of those involved in the protest."
8703008,19949,"The article highlights the challenges faced by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in managing the Bluff Point Coastal Reserve, a unique 800-acre property with fragile dunes, upland forests, old farmlands, and salt marshes. The reserve is currently underutilized, but there are proposals to develop it into a bathing beach with amenities like ranger headquarters, an education center, and parking facilities.

The Friends of Bluff Point, an environmental group, opposes any changes that would violate the intent of the 1975 legislation establishing the reserve as a coastal area to be preserved in its natural state. They argue that the reserve is not just a state park but a unique piece of property with ecological, scenic, and historical values.

On the other hand, David Winkler, a Groton town councilman, has proposed developing the beach and surrounding areas into a recreational site with amenities like a bathing beach, parking facilities, and electric vehicles to transport visitors. He claims that his proposals would not harm the reserve's fragile environment and argues that the state has abandoned the area to the birds and animals.

The DEP is working on a management plan for Bluff Point, which includes improving the road to the parking lot, hiring full-time staff, including rangers and assistants, and providing educational presentations at the entrance. However, there are concerns about the feasibility of developing the beach into a bathing area due to the fragile nature of the dunes.

To better utilize what's there, present it to people, and protect the fragile resources, some suggestions could be:

1. Implement more frequent patrols of the reserve by the DEP to prevent motorcyclists from damaging trails and visitors from trampling on the dunes.
2. Develop a management plan that balances recreation with conservation goals and ensures that any development is consistent with the intent of the 1975 legislation.
3. Provide educational presentations at the entrance of the reserve to raise awareness about its unique features and importance in preserving its natural state.
4. Install barriers to keep motorcycles and four-wheel-drive vehicles off the trails, but allow people to access the area.
5. Consider alternative recreational activities that do not require intensive development, such as hiking, bird-watching, or kayaking.

Overall, the debate highlights the need for a balanced approach that protects the reserve's fragile resources while still providing opportunities for recreation and education."

4. Procession or marching (22): Although the article doesn't explicitly state that the protesters marched, the fact that they gathered across the street from the rally and held a silent vigil suggests some form of procession or march may have been involved."

8703048,22044,"Here is a summarized version of the article about AIDS:

**The Early Years (1981-1984)**

* Doctors in California and New York reported cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, among homosexual men.
* Similar cases were seen in drug users, especially black and Hispanic addicts in the Northeastern United States.
* Researchers isolated a new virus from AIDS patients in France (1983) and built a convincing case that it was the cause of AIDS.

**Transmission and Spread**

* The virus spreads through:
	+ Sexual intercourse between homosexual men
	+ Contaminated needles shared by drug users
	+ Infected mothers to their babies before birth
	+ Contaminated medical transfusions (until 1985)
* Evidence indicates that the virus was transmitted frequently through heterosexual intercourse in Africa and Haiti.
* No evidence of transmission through close, nonsexual daily contact.

**Consequences**

* The virus swept through the homosexual community, probably infecting half or more of men in cities like New York and San Francisco.
* Drug addicts were also heavily infected.
* Women became infected, often from contaminated needles or sexual contact with an infected person.
* Nearly 400 children have developed AIDS after being born infected with the virus.

**Current Situation**

* Up to 1.5 million Americans carry the AIDS virus in their bodies.
* Perhaps one-fourth of them will develop AIDS within five years.
* All carriers are presumed to be infected for life and able to pass the virus to others.

**Concerns and Future Risks**

* The disease has spread beyond cities where it first became entrenched; AIDS now appears in every state.
* There is concern about how widely it may have spread or might spread among heterosexuals not involved with illegal drugs.
* Urgent calls are being made for nationwide campaigns to educate people about the risks.

**Global Impact**

* The epidemic is global, with Africa being particularly hard hit.
* Surveys reveal startling rates of AIDS virus infection in some cities - close to one in 10 adults.
* Evidence suggests that at least one other virus, related to the originally discovered AIDS virus, might also be causing disease in parts of Africa.
* The World Health Organization estimates that some 10 million people may already be infected with the AIDS virus worldwide."

8703057,24019,"This news article reports on the Supreme Court case McCleskey v. Kemp, which challenges Georgia's death-sentencing process based on allegations of racial discrimination. The case involves Warren McCleskey, a black man who was sentenced to death for killing a white police officer in 1978.

The argument presented by McCleskey's lawyers is that blacks who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than other defendants. This contention is supported by statistics showing that of the 70 executions that have taken place since the Supreme Court upheld some revised death penalty laws in 1976, nearly all (60%) were of black defendants, and most of those executed had killed white victims.

The study conducted by David Baldus, a law professor at the University of Iowa, found that blacks who had killed whites were sentenced to death at three times the rate of whites who had killed blacks. The study controlled for various factors that might influence sentencing decisions, such as the viciousness of the crime and the quality of the evidence.

However, the Supreme Court has historically been leery of using social science data as a basis for legal precedent in criminal cases. As a result, McCleskey faces a formidable obstacle in his effort to overturn his conviction based on statistics.

The case has generated intense debate, with some arguing that it is an attack on the South's criminal justice system and others viewing it as an opportunity to address long-standing issues of racial discrimination in the administration of capital punishment."

Explanation:
1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (Answer 20) - The article mentions that Michael Jones was beaten and assaulted by several white students, which can be seen as a form of protest or demonstration.
2. Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on (Answer 27) - The news conference called by the Concerned Black Students of Columbia University is an example of speechmaking.
3. Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters signature (Answer 18) - Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, it can be inferred that the group may have obtained signatures or presented a petition to authorities or other parties involved in the incident.
4. Singing collectively (Answer 44) - There is no direct mention of singing in the article, but it's possible that some form of collective singing or chanting occurred during the protest or demonstration."
8703063,24605,"Based on this article, it appears that University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is facing an image problem on two fronts. Firstly, the school's athletic program, particularly basketball, has been tainted by recruiting violations and other scandals in the past, which has led to a perception that UNLV is not honest in its athletics.

Secondly, the university's location in Las Vegas, known for its gaming industry, has led to concerns about the school's reputation being associated with the city's reputation as a hub of excess and immorality. The article suggests that the university is trying to change this perception by emphasizing its academic programs and distancing itself from the city's gaming industry.

The article also highlights UNLV President Maxson's efforts to improve the school's image, including implementing a scholarship fund for Nevada high school valedictorians and ending special admissions for athletes. Maxson has also instituted a policy of suspending athletes accused of felonies pending the outcome of their trials, which is seen as an effort to maintain academic integrity.

Overall, it seems that UNLV is trying to shed its reputation as a ""party school"" and establish itself as a reputable institution with strong academic programs. However, the Daniels case and other scandals may continue to undermine these efforts unless the university can demonstrate a commitment to upholding high standards of ethics and integrity in all aspects of its operations."

* Despite efforts to contain violent crime, including mandatory jail sentences for gun violations and curfews for teen-agers, homicides have risen nearly 20% over the first quarter of this year.
* A support group called Save Our Sons and Daughters has been formed by mothers whose children have been shot.
* The group provides a 24-hour hot line for words of encouragement and attends wakes to console families.
* Physicians at Detroit Receiving Hospital report seeing more assaults and homicides, with patients often returning to the emergency room after another violent encounter.

Overall, the article highlights the devastating impact of youth violence in Detroit, particularly among poor inner-city black males. It also showcases the emotional toll on families and communities affected by these crimes, as well as the frustration and desperation that can drive calls for harsher measures to address the problem."

8705013,38530,"This article reports on the lifting of a ban on school dances at Ames High School in Oklahoma, which was supported by a group of parents and students who were opposed to the ban. The ban had been in place for some time, and it was seen as a restriction on the social lives of students.

The article quotes several individuals who were involved in the effort to lift the ban, including Rev. Carl Tinnea Jr., minister of the Ames Christian Church, who is known as ""the dancing preacher."" His daughter, Christy, also speaks out in support of lifting the ban.

The article notes that there was opposition to lifting the ban from some parents and community members, who argued that dancing was linked to other social issues such as drug use, alcohol consumption, and premarital sex. However, the majority of parents supported lifting the ban, and the school board ultimately decided to allow school dances to take place.

The article also mentions that Ames is a small town in rural Oklahoma with limited entertainment options for young people, making the ability to attend school dances important for students' social lives.

**Protest/Dispute:** The Chippewa tribe in Wisconsin is protesting the state's hunting and fishing regulations, claiming that they have unrestricted rights under a treaty signed in 1837.

**Reason for Protest:** The Chippewa are upset because the state regulates their hunting and fishing activities beyond the reservation, while they believe they should be allowed to continue their traditional practices without restrictions.

**Groups Involved:**

* Lac du Flambeau tribal chairman Mike Allen Sr.
* Wisconsin State Attorney General's office (represented by Assistant AG John D. Niemisto)
* Hunters' group ""Protect America's Rights and Resources"" (led by Larry E. Greschner)

**Key Issues:** 

* Hunting and fishing rights on public and private land
* Regulation of Indian hunting and fishing activities beyond the reservation
* Historical treaty rights vs. modern-day regulations

**Protest Methods:**

* Protest march held by ""Protect America's Rights and Resources""
* Stone-throwing incident involving protesters who were arrested
* Boycotts, such as the Little League considering not playing games at the reservation this year

**Tone:** The article portrays a tense and sometimes hostile atmosphere between the Chippewa tribe and non-Native groups in Wisconsin. There are allegations of harassment and discrimination against Native Americans, and some protesters have made derogatory comments about Indians."
8705028,41949,"Here are my answers:

16; 20; 28; 97

Code Explanation:
16: The article mentions ""intimidated"" patients and staff members, which implies silence or silent protest.

20: Holding signs or placarding is a common form of protest, which fits the description in the article about the protesters breaking into the clinic, damaging equipment, and harassing patients.

28: Sloganeering/chanting refers to shouting slogans, which was not explicitly mentioned in the article but could be inferred from the description of the protesters' actions as ""demonstration"".

97: Lawsuits are a form of protest activity aimed at seeking legal remedies or challenging existing laws. In this case, the lawsuit filed by the Northeast Women's Center and the appeal planned by Mr. Volz fit this category."

8705038,45151,"The message is that the use of only whites or predominantly whites in advertisements sends a message about exclusivity and potential discrimination. The article highlights the controversy surrounding the lack of diversity in models used in real estate advertisements, particularly in newspapers. Some argue that this perpetuates racial bias and excludes certain groups from viewing these properties as desirable places to live.

The article quotes several individuals, including lawyers, activists, and advertisers, who weigh in on the issue. Some defend the practice as a marketing strategy aimed at appealing to a specific demographic profile. Others view it as discriminatory and argue that it sets an exclusionary tone, implying that certain groups are not welcome or desirable.

The article also mentions lawsuits and court rulings related to this issue. For example, Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. ruled in 1983 that the Fair Housing Act prohibits real-estate companies from making dominant use of white models in producing advertisements. This ruling was based on a case involving a local company that had used only white models in an advertisement.

Overall, the message is that the use of predominantly whites or lack of diversity in models can perpetuate racial bias and exclusionary attitudes, and that advertisers should strive to be more inclusive and representative in their advertising practices."

8706011,48463,"The article discusses the ongoing struggle over the Delaware River pumping station project in Pennsylvania, which has been controversial for decades due to concerns about its environmental impact and economic viability.

Key points:

1. The project has been stalled since 1983 when anti-pump forces won a referendum and took control of the Bucks County government.
2. The new administration of Gov. Robert P. Casey is reviewing the project, which opponents believe will ultimately lead to its cancellation.
3. Proponents of the project, including the Philadelphia Electric Company, argue that it is environmentally sound and necessary for energy generation.
4. Opponents fear that the project will damage the ecology of the Delaware River and create industrial ditches out of natural streams.
5. The Casey administration must decide by June 30 whether to extend state permits required for construction to continue.
6. If the permits are denied, a conflict between the courts and the state executive could develop, as proponents have already filed suit to enforce the original construction contract.

Economic and environmental grounds are driving the opposition to the project:

1. Concerns about water level fluctuations in the Delaware River and ecological damage resulting from the pumping station's operation.
2. Fear that increased water flow will stimulate development and alter the character of pastoral communities.
3. Opposition to the transfer of water from one basin (Delaware) to another (Schuylkill), which opponents believe sets an ecological precedent.

The struggle is not just about environmental concerns, but also about democratic principles:

1. The 1983 referendum victory by anti-pump forces demonstrated that democracy can work in favor of environmental protection.
2. The protesters' chants and signs emphasize the importance of protecting the river and the need for a democratic process that prioritizes ecological sustainability.

The outcome is uncertain, with both sides confident they will ultimately prevail:

1. Proponents believe the project's environmental soundness and necessity for energy generation will prevail.
2. Opponents hope that Governor Casey will cancel the project or deny construction permits, which would effectively kill the project.

Overall, this struggle highlights the ongoing tension between economic development and environmental protection in Pennsylvania, with far-reaching implications for water management policy generally."

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The legal aid lawyers and advocates are described as being ""ethically prohibited"" from accepting the state's stipulation, which implies that they were holding signs or distributing information to oppose the policy change.
* 28: Sue in best interest of client - Although not a traditional form of protest, the Legal Aid Bureau's lawsuit against the state can be seen as a form of collective action or advocacy for the rights of indigent and disabled people.
* 43: Negotiated settlement failed - This activity is mentioned specifically in the article, where the legal aid group tried to negotiate a solution with the state before filing their lawsuit.

2. Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters, signature (code 18): Although not explicitly stated, the protest is likely seeking support from readers through petitioning or presenting their demands to the company.
3. Procession or marching (code 22): The article mentions that some articles were published without bylines, which could be interpreted as a procession or march of reporters and other staff members participating in the protest.

It appears that the tenants of the Holland Hotel are struggling with various issues, including poor living conditions, lack of trust in authorities, and feelings of helplessness. However, they have come together to form an association, which has been recognized by the Citizens Committee for New York City.

The article highlights the challenges faced by the tenants' association, including transience and apathy among some residents, as well as opposition from the hotel's management. Despite these obstacles, the group has managed to achieve some successes, such as persuading local businesses to donate food and obtaining support from city officials.

It's interesting to note that the article frames the struggle of the tenants' association as a fight for dignity and respect. The quote ""We wanted to be treated more like human beings than animals"" suggests that the residents feel dehumanized by their living conditions, and that their efforts are aimed at reclaiming their humanity.

Overall, this article provides a powerful example of how marginalized communities can come together to challenge systemic injustices and demand change."

* Concerns raised:
	+ Presence of adult bookstore in residential area with nearby schools and children's homes
	+ Fear of economic loss due to decreased property values and potential harm to the community
	+ Concerns about who frequents the store and their intentions when leaving the premises
* Store owner, Robert Scherer, responses:
	+ Chose location for heavy traffic on Sunrise Highway and proximity to other businesses
	+ Enforces strict policy of selling only to those over 21, despite state law allowing sales to minors at age 18
	+ Offers to tone down signs to a less provocative name like Cupid's Corner but refuses to consider moving the store

**Court Involvement**

* Village code enforcement officers charged Scherer and his landlord with six violations, including operating an adult bookstore and failure to obtain permits for signs.
* Trial was set for August 12, but Scherer said he would process paperwork and the case is unlikely to be shut down.

**Community Reaction**

* Lindenhurst Mayor Thomas H. Kost assigned an auxiliary policeman to record license-plate numbers of store customers, allowing protesters to write letters asking them not to patronize the store.
* Suffolk chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union became involved, threatening a lawsuit if the village continued its efforts.
* Concerned Residents Against Pornography group plans community rallies and canvassing efforts to protest the store's presence.

**Store Owner's Perspective**

* Scherer believes that private protests and public enforcement are attempts to restrict what people can do in their own homes.
* He emphasizes that his average customer is there for only five minutes, and most are married couples or respectable-looking individuals.
* He rejects concerns about children's welfare, stating that if parents instill morals in their children, they don't have to worry about the store."

8707041,58296,"You are referring to the bombing incident three years ago in Nicaragua, which was allegedly planned by former United States intelligence agents and military officers, financed by profits from narcotics sales, and assisted by Government officials. The Christic Institute, a non-profit organization founded in 1980, has filed a lawsuit against 29 defendants, including General Richard Secord and Oliver North, alleging that they were involved in the bombing.

The lawsuit seeks $20 million in damages on behalf of two American freelance journalists who were injured in the bombing. The institute's chief counsel, Daniel Sheehan, is leading the investigation into the bombing, which has been ongoing for several years.

Despite initial skepticism from Federal agents and US prosecutors, some lawmakers and Congressional investigators have begun to take the allegations seriously. In November 1986, the Iran-contra affair was disclosed, confirming one of the suit's principal contentions that Oliver North, Richard Secord, and other CIA operatives were secretly directing the contras in a war against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua.

The investigation has been challenging, but Sheehan is confident that it will be ready to go to trial in Miami sometime next year. The case has drawn international attention, with many people around the world following its progress.

Some notable details from the suit include:

* The bombing was planned by former US intelligence agents and military officers.
* The bombing was financed by profits from narcotics sales.
* The Government officials assisted in the planning of the bombing.
* Glenn A. Robinette, a former CIA agent, testified that General Secord paid him over $100,000 to develop derogatory information about participants in the Christic lawsuit.

Overall, the case has significant implications for US foreign policy and national security, as well as for the journalists who were injured in the bombing."

8708020,67288,"Here are some key points about the 1986 Howard Beach racial incident:

1. **Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man from Brooklyn**, was killed after trying to flee from a group of white youths who had attacked him and two other black men at a pizzeria in Howard Beach, Queens.
2. The defense lawyers for the four white youths charged with murder or manslaughter argue that the incident was not racially motivated, but rather a case of self-defense.
3. **A knife** with a 3-to-4-inch blade was found to have been possessed by Timothy Grimes, one of the black men involved in the altercation. This discovery is seen as significant by the defense lawyers, who argue that it undermines the credibility of Grimes, who is expected to be an important prosecution witness.
4. **Robert Riley, 18**, one of the defendants charged with murder or manslaughter, has agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and will not stand trial in exchange for pleading guilty to assault.
5. The incident began when Griffith, Grimes, and Cedric Sandiford (Griffith's stepfather) were attacked as they left a pizzeria after their car broke down nearby. The attackers allegedly shouted racial slurs and one of them said, ""There's some niggers in the pizza parlor - let's go kill them.""
6. **Two trials** are scheduled to begin on September 8th in State Supreme Court in Queens, with four white youths charged with murder or manslaughter facing trial first, followed by a second trial for seven other youths charged with lesser crimes.
7. The prosecution has offered to drop or reduce charges against some of the defendants if they cooperate with the investigation.

Overall, this incident was marked by racial tension and violence, and the revelation of the knife's existence adds a new layer of complexity to the case."

**Issue:** Redistricting and adjustment of census data for population-based federal funding allocation.

**Concerns:**

1. **Undercounting:** Past censuses have undercounted certain populations, such as black Americans (1 in 20) and young black males (1 in 10).
2. **Inequitable distribution:** The undercount disproportionately affects big cities, where Democrats outnumber Republicans.
3. **Lack of adjustment:** Critics argue that the Census Bureau should commit to adjusting the data in advance rather than leaving it until later.
4. **Time constraints:** Adjusting the data could add three months to the timeline for completing and reporting the census.
5. **Racial implications:** The adjustment is seen as a civil rights concern, particularly for minority communities who stand to benefit from increased federal funding and representation.

**Key stakeholders:**

1. **Census Bureau:** Director John Keane, Associate Director Charles O. Jones
2. **Academics:** Professors Joseph B. Kadane (Carnegie Mellon), Michael A. Stolto (Harvard), David Freedman (University of California)
3. **Elected officials:** Representative Robert Garcia (Democrat, Bronx)
4. **Community leaders:** Patricia C. Becker (Detroit's Planning Department), Aileen Hernandez (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund)

**Timeline:**

1. **April 1990:** Census day
2. **July 1990:** Random sample survey to adjust census data
3. **December 31, 1990:** Initial deadline for reporting state totals

**Outcomes:**

1. **Adjustment of census data:** Theoretically possible through random sample surveys and computer matching.
2. **Redistricting:** The adjusted data could impact the redrawing of House districts and allocation of federal funds.

8709017,72050,"This article discusses the trial preparation for the case involving the death of Alton H. Maddox Jr., a 48-year-old black man who was beaten and run over by a car in Howard Beach, Queens, on December 20th. The defense lawyers claim that the incident was not a racially motivated attack, but rather a confrontation between two groups where the black men were aggressive and armed with at least one knife.

The defense will attack the credibility of the two surviving black men who testified and another important prosecution witness, Robert Riley, who has agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in return for being permitted to plead guilty to assault. The defense lawyers also claim that the evidence will show that Mr. Griffith's death was an accident for which the defendants were not responsible.

The trial is expected to be difficult due to the extensive publicity surrounding the case, and both sides are preparing intensively. The prosecution has used mock jury-selection sessions to analyze juror traits and prepare questions to draw out attitudes towards potential jurors. The defense has not used a jury consultant because it could not afford one.

One of the challenges in selecting an impartial jury is that many people have been affected by the publicity surrounding the case, including news reports comparing it to another incident involving three black teen-agers who were attacked and beaten by about 20 whites shouting racial slurs. The defense will move to postpone the trial due to this publicity.

The maximum sentence for second-degree murder is 25-years-to-life in prison, while the maximum for second-degree manslaughter is 5-to-15 years in prison. Seven other teen-agers accused of being part of the gang that was involved in the incident will be tried later on charges ranging from attempted murder to inciting to riot.

The trial could take up to two months, including two weeks of jury selection, according to estimates. Justice Demakos is considering an option where he would interview prospective jurors individually to weed out those who it appeared could not be impartial."

2. **Ernestness of defense**: Judge Bork showed a strong willingness to defend himself, but his statements were met with skepticism by some senators. This suggests that he would need to continue making his case to win over undecided senators.
3. **Concerns about judicial activism**: Senator Dennis DeConcini expressed concerns that Judge Bork might be a ""conservative judicial activist"" who would impose his own political views on the court. Judge Bork sought to dispel these concerns by emphasizing that his views were not ""eccentric"" and that he was open to persuasion by others.
4. **Concessions**: Judge Bork acknowledged that it was too late to reverse many major Supreme Court decisions, but he also emphasized that he would be less ""speculative"" as a justice than he had been in academia or through his writings.
5. **Serious demeanor**: Unlike some expectations, Judge Bork came across as serious and pedagogical rather than humorous or warm. This may have made it harder for him to connect with the lay audience or win over undecided senators.
6. **Lack of popular appeal**: The article suggests that Judge Bork's testimony did not necessarily help him build a popular following, which is important given the high stakes surrounding his nomination.

Overall, this news article provides insight into the challenges and controversies surrounding Judge Robert Bork's confirmation hearings."
8709036,75132,"This article discusses the Catholic Church's response to AIDS and its treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals. The Pope has made public comments on AIDS, stating that healthcare workers are obliged to show ""the love and compassion of Christ and His church"" to those suffering from the disease. However, some critics argue that his remarks have been taken as blaming immoral behavior for the spread of AIDS.

The article highlights the mixed feelings among Catholics who have contracted AIDS. Some, like R. Daniel LaFleur, do not feel attacked by the Pope's comments and appreciate the church's efforts to care for those affected. Others, like Leonard Matlovich, are outraged by the Pope's plans to see AIDS patients, feeling that it is a ""deliberate slap in the face.""

The article also discusses the Vatican's letter on ""the pastoral care of homosexual persons,"" which was widely criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates and some Catholic theologians. The letter appeared to harden the church's stance against homosexuality, calling the orientation itself ""disordered."" This language has been interpreted as rejecting the existence of same-sex attraction.

In contrast, local Catholic dioceses are beginning to take a more compassionate approach. For example, in Houston, a Catholic chaplain corps is counseling the dying and holding memorial services for bereaved homosexual lovers. In another example, St. Mary's Parish in Humble, Texas, is housing two destitute AIDS patients, making no moral judgments or asking questions.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of the Catholic Church's response to AIDS, highlighting both the efforts of local dioceses and the criticisms leveled at the Vatican's stance on homosexuality."
8709080,75132,"This article discusses the complexities and ambiguities faced by the Catholic Church in addressing the AIDS epidemic, particularly with regards to its stance on homosexuality. The Pope has made comments about showing love and compassion to those affected by AIDS, but also emphasized that the disease is rooted in immorality.

Some Catholics suffering from AIDS have mixed feelings about the Church's response. R. Daniel LaFleur, a 31-year-old who will meet the Pope, does not harbor resentment towards the Church's stance. However, others like Leonard Matlovich are outraged by the Pope's plans to see AIDS patients and feel that the Church is not doing enough to support those affected.

The Vatican's letter on ""the pastoral care of homosexual persons"" has been criticized for hardening the Church's stance against homosexuality and failing to acknowledge the severity of the AIDS crisis. The letter has also been seen as a threat to organizations that support gay rights and challenge the Church's teachings.

In contrast, some Catholic leaders have taken a more compassionate approach. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco issued a pastoral letter calling for compassion and understanding towards those affected by AIDS. Local parishes in Houston and California have also established programs to provide care and support to those suffering from the disease.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by the Catholic Church in balancing its moral teachings with its desire to show compassion and support to those affected by AIDS. While some Catholics have criticized the Church's response as inadequate or even hostile, others have praised efforts to provide care and support to those in need."

8709048,76870,"Here are the protest activities codes:

Code explanation:
1. Meditation, ordinarily silent (16), refers to the court's finding that Congress departed from generalized copyright legislation and enacted special copyright protection for a religious entity in order to enhance its sway over the manner of religious worship.
2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20), is an analogy for the appellants' argument that the law confers upon a religious body an unusual measure of copyright protection by unusual means.
3. Vigiling silent protest holding placards, banners (29), represents the court's finding that the law does not have a secular purpose, as required by the Supreme Court.
4. Other activity (98) is an acknowledgement that the case involves other activities beyond protests, but the coding system doesn't provide a specific code for ""court ruling"" or ""judicial decision""."
8709056,77583,"Yes, an overcrowded system can be caused by an explosion in demand for foster care. In this case, the increase in the number of children removed from their families due to abuse or neglect has led to a surge in the need for foster care services. The city's failure to provide adequate alternatives and place children in stable and supervised environments has resulted in a crisis situation.

The judge's ruling highlights the problems with the current system, including:

1. Inadequate supervision: Children are being sent from home to home without any coordinated supervision of their basic needs or support.
2. Instability and disruption: The constant changes in placement can cause physical, emotional, and psychological harm to children.
3. Lack of attention and care: Older children with special needs require attention, psychiatric care, and stability, but are instead receiving instability and neglect.

The judge's decision calls for the city to take immediate action to address these problems and provide a more stable and supportive foster care system. This may include:

1. Increasing payments to foster parents
2. Government takeover of most foster care services
3. Providing adequate alternatives to overnight placements
4. Improving coordination and supervision of child placement

The case studies presented in the article highlight the devastating effects of the current system on individual children, such as Ricardo Doe, who experienced multiple overnight placements without any attempt to keep him connected with his family or receive stable care."

2. The article describes protesters holding signs and picketing, which falls under ""holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing"" (code 20).
3. The chairman of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board makes a statement about the revocation, which can be categorized under ""speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on"" (code 27).
4. The article does not explicitly describe any other protest activities beyond these three, but mentions that lawyers for the club said it would probably appeal the revocation to the courts, which can be categorized under ""Other activity"" (code 98)."

8710008,79885,"The controversy surrounds bars on North Avenue, also known as ""the Strip"", which has been plagued by noise, rowdiness, and vandalism concerns from local residents. The situation was initially brought to the attention of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) a year ago by Iona College, who were concerned about underage students being served alcohol.

The SLA has taken action against two bars on North Avenue: Tammany Hall, which was charged with noise, misconduct, and disorder in the premises or area; and Take 5, which promoted two alcohol-free nights a week until a few months ago. The owner of Take 5 pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a hearing.

The New Rochelle Fire Commissioner has also expressed concerns about Tammany Hall's overcrowding, which was removed earlier this year due to safety issues. The bar's owners claim that the city is engaging in selective enforcement and attempting to run them out of business.

Iona College has responded by launching a ""No Booze Cruise"" initiative, which aims to raise awareness about the dangers of alcohol abuse among students and the community. The college has also invited speakers to discuss medical, legal, psychological, and personal experiences related to drinking.

Overall, the controversy highlights the ongoing social problem of student drinking and the need for a coordinated approach involving the college, city officials, and local residents to address these issues and promote safety and well-being in the community."

**Protest**: The Legal Aid Society (LAS) has been pressing a lawsuit against the city over the conditions at Bellevue Hospital for six years. LAS claims that inmate patients at Bellevue are not being allowed to visit with their children, have no opportunity for outdoor exercise, and receive inadequate medical care.

**Violations**: According to LAS, Bellevue's quarters are dirty, infested with mice, and contain potential fire hazards. Patients are only given pajamas for daytime wear and have limited access to psychiatric treatment.

**Abuse**: Correction officers at Bellevue have been accused of engaging in ""vicious and brutal misconduct,"" including the use of straitjackets and manhandling patients who try to cross a red line to speak with nurses.

**Neglect**: LAS claims that some patients received no medical care, while others were seen by physicians only briefly once a week. The society also reported finding blank physical examination records in nine patient charts, despite laboratory tests showing syphilis and liver abnormalities.

**Lack of Accountability**: Despite reports of abuse and neglect, the city has not held correction officers accountable for their actions. Instead, they have focused on removing and disciplining officers who engage in gratuitous brutality.

**Ongoing Litigation**: The lawsuit between LAS and the city is ongoing, with both parties disagreeing over the extent to which Bellevue's practices violate hospital accreditation standards and court-set standards for jail conditions."

The third activity is wreathing or laying wreaths or floral arrangements on statues or memorials (32). Although there is no direct mention of wreath-laying in the article, it's likely that students might have done so during their demonstration.

The fourth activity is worshipping/church service format of a rally or demonstration (31). The article mentions that Sister Joyce Mahany said, ""I stand very firmly behind what we have.

8710023,82146,"This article reports on the successful transformation of vacant buildings in East New York, Brooklyn, into low-income housing through a mutual housing association. The project was made possible by the collaboration between community organizers from Acorn (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and philanthropic organizations like the New York Foundation and Consumer-Farmer.

The article highlights the struggles of two residents, Jacinto Camacho and Norma Jusino, who had been living in substandard conditions before being able to take over their own homes through the mutual housing association. It also notes the role played by community organizing group Acorn, which has a long history of advocating for low-income housing and was instrumental in bringing about change.

The article also mentions the involvement of Borough President Howard Golden and his executive assistant, Marilyn Gelber, who worked with Acorn to address the issue of vacant buildings in Brooklyn. The Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development played a key role in mediating the process, helping to negotiate an arrangement that would allow for the rehabilitation of the buildings.

The mutual housing association model, which allows residents to contribute labor and capital to rehabilitate buildings for their own use, is seen as a promising solution for creating low-income housing. However, experts caution that this approach requires sustained commitment from the community and government, as well as significant investment in infrastructure and resources.

Overall, the article presents a positive account of the transformation of vacant buildings into low-income housing, highlighting the role played by community organizers, government officials, and philanthropic organizations in making it happen."

8710033,86413,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding the proposed construction of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in California, with a focus on the farm-based economy and community support.

Protesters' Arguments:

1. Irreparable harm to the region's farm-based economy
2. Quality of life in Yolo and Solano counties would be forever changed
3. The project would sit in the middle of several known geological fault zones that have produced powerful earthquakes, making it a waste if the collider were to move even slightly

Farmers' concerns:

1. 8,000 acres of prime farm land on the surface would be taken for a research campus and other purposes
2. Traffic jams, air pollution, and urban ills would increase with 20,000 people settling in the area

Supporters' Arguments:

1. The project would diversify and strengthen the region's economy by attracting clean and high-technology businesses
2. The collider would attract some of the brightest minds in the world to the region

Key Players:

1. Craig McNamara: A walnut grower who organized the Super Collider Action Committee and collected 10,000 signatures on a petition opposing the project.
2. Foy McNaughton: Publisher of The Davis Enterprise, a daily newspaper, and leader of the Super Collider for America Committee.

Timeline:

* Last spring: Craig McNamara discovered that 120 of his 520 acres could be condemned and taken over by the state if the atom smasher were built in his area.
* Last summer: Mr. McNamara's group collected 10,000 signatures on a petition opposing the project.
* Next July: The Energy Department plans to narrow its list to five sites.
* January 1989: The final site is expected to be selected."

8711029,94733,"Here are the protest details extracted from the news article:

**Event:** Judge Sand issues an injunction against private development in Yonkers, halting major projects until the city complies with a court order to desegregate housing.

**Protestors:** The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Justice Department, who brought the discrimination case against Yonkers.

**Reasons for Protest:** The city was not prepared to act voluntarily and had shown ""obstructive and dilatory tactics"" in responding to Judge Sand's order to desegregate housing. The city had previously voted on a plan to build 200 units of low- and middle-income housing, but failed to follow through.

**Consequences:** The injunction will halt all major development projects in Yonkers, including the Austin Avenue Executive Office Development, Wilmorite Shopping Mall, Southwest Westchester Executive Park, and Pierpoint on the Hudson. This could have significant economic and social implications for the city.

**Reactions:**

* Corporation Counsel Jay Hashmall called Judge Sand's action an ""overreaction"" and said it could bring a halt to all major development in the city.
* Michael Sussman, a lawyer for the NAACP, said Judge Sand's action would ""help to coerce the city"" into responding to the court order.
* Curtis Berger, a professor of real-estate law at Columbia University Law School, noted that there is no precedent for an injunction like this in housing discrimination cases.

**Background:** The city of Yonkers was found guilty of intentional discrimination in education and housing over a span of four decades. Judge Sand had previously ordered the city to desegregate housing by building 200-1,000 low- and middle-income units, but the city failed to comply."

8711032,95467,"Here are the key points extracted from the news article:

**Case Overview**

* A lawsuit has been filed in California against Pacific Bell, a telephone company, alleging that their failure to block children's access to pornography resulted in emotional injury and ridicule for two families.
* The lawsuit seeks $10 million in damages.

**Key Issues**

* Freedom of speech: The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is a key issue in this case, as it is in other disputes over pornography.
* Incitement: Whether listening or watching simulation of sexual conduct can incite children to aberrant or criminal behavior is also an issue.
* Negligence: The lawsuit charges Pacific Bell and the providers of sexual phone messages with negligence in distributing harmful matter to minors.

**Background**

* Federal regulations were established after earlier rules were held to be unconstitutional, aiming to limit minors' access to pornographic telephone messages.
* Pacific Bell has a policy not to comment on lawsuits involving it.
* The Public Utilities Commission does not allow telephone companies to censor the messages or discriminate among dial-for-a-message services based on content.

**Legal Challenges**

* A decision in an Arizona case by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit may change the view of what is constitutionally permissible.
* Lawyers for Carlin Communications Inc. have petitioned the appeals court for a rehearing of the Mountain Bell case.
* The Federal Communications Commission rules require dial-a-porn services to screen out calls by minors, but these rules only apply to interstate calls.

**Consequences**

* President Reagan has proposed legislation making it a crime punishable by six months in jail and a $50,000 fine to use interstate telephone calls to communicate indecent material to minors for commercial purposes.
* Pacific Bell has asked the State Public Utilities Commission to approve a plan allowing customers to block calls from their phones to dial-a-porn numbers within the state."

**Prison Uprising:**

* A riot broke out at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary on Saturday, involving an unknown number of Cuban prisoners.
* The uprising started around 11 a.m. and lasted throughout the day and night.
* Inmates set fire to a prison factory and other buildings, causing extensive damage.

**Negotiations:**

* Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, attempted to negotiate with Federal officials but was turned away due to concerns about safety.
* A team of Federal negotiators reported no progress in talks with inmates.

**Situation:**

* The prison is surrounded by a cordon of heavy firepower from National Guardsmen, F.B.I. agents, and city/state police officers.
* Inmates are armed with knives, pipes, and other makeshift weapons but have not used guns.
* Hostages, including guards and staff members, are being held by the inmates.

**Background:**

* The prison is home to 1,392 Cuban prisoners, making it one of the largest concentrations of Cubans in the Federal prison system.
* The prison has a history of problems, including a riot in 1984 that caused $1 million in damage and no injuries.
* The prison is currently undergoing a $63 million renovation designed to make it a state-of-the-art facility.

**Reactions:**

* Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison to await news of developments.
* Some inmates have returned voluntarily to their cells, while others continue to hold out for concessions.

Overall, the situation at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary appears to be a tense and potentially long-standing standoff between inmates and authorities."

The article mentions a conflict between the police and fire unions, with tension escalating to physical altercations. The firefighters' union is protesting Mayor Koch's decision to subordinate their department's role to the police at all emergencies except fires.

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (implied by the article, but not explicitly stated)

* 27: Speechmaking, references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on

The article quotes the head of the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, who are likely speaking out against Mayor Koch's decision and advocating for their department's interests.

* 98: Other activity (as this protest doesn't fit any specific category)

2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20): Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, I inferred that the protesters are holding signs and engaging in informational picketing to raise awareness about their cause.
3. Sloganeering/chanting (28): The protesters may be chanting slogans or phrases to express their demands and garner support for their cause.

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (the article quotes lawyers on both sides of the case claiming victory, which implies a protest-like atmosphere, but no specific mention of holding signs or placards)
* 29: Vigiling, silent protest, holding placards, banners (although there is no direct mention of vigiling or holding placards/banners, the tone of the article suggests a sense of protest and dissent)

4. Other forms of protest (98)

8801022,110174,"What a powerful and poignant article! Here are some key points I extracted from this news piece:

**Protest and Unity**: After the death of truck driver and father of six, Rodney Garner, at the hands of white law-enforcement officers in Sabine County jail, local residents came together to hold an interracial meeting at a black church. This gathering was a rare occurrence in the predominantly white town.

**Indictments**: Three white law enforcement officers have been indicted on felony civil rights charges connected to Garner's death. They have pleaded not guilty and no trial date has been set.

**Common Ground**: Despite racial differences, many speakers emphasized that the incident was not about race, but rather about rampant brutality by local law-enforcement officers. Many attendees shared personal experiences of being harassed or mistreated by authorities, regardless of their race.

**Concerns and Grievances**: The meeting also addressed old grievances, with blacks complaining about job opportunities and lack of black representation in local government. Whites shared concerns about systemic problems, including police brutality and corruption.

**Unity and Hope**: Despite the challenges and conflicts, many attendees expressed hope and a sense of unity. One speaker quoted Martin Luther King Jr., saying that this tragedy was not in vain and that it had brought people together.

This article highlights the complexities of race relations in America, particularly in small towns where racial tensions can run high. The fact that blacks and whites came together to protest and seek change is a testament to the power of unity and the human desire for justice and equality."
8801024,110388,"Here are some key points extracted from the news article:

* A proposal for a development project on Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains was rejected by the Common Council.
* The project, proposed by Caspi Development, would have included 30-40 small stores and a four-level underground garage with 766 parking spaces.
* The development would have been built on a 3.8-acre vacant lot at the south end of Mamaroneck Avenue, at a cost of about $55 million.
* The proposal was designed by Der Scutt, an architect who also designed Trump Tower and 100 United Nations Plaza.
* The project faced opposition from nearby residents, who were concerned about increased traffic and congestion in the area.
* The Common Council voted against the proposal after a public hearing, with all members voting against it.
* Stephen Caspi, president of Caspi Development, threatened to sue the city if the project was rejected, and claimed that the city had not properly evaluated the environmental impact of the development.
* The rejection of the project is part of a larger trend in White Plains, where developers have faced resistance from residents and the Common Council over proposed developments."
8801027,110935,"**Deplored Acts of Racially Motivated Violence**

In a peaceful demonstration outside City Hall in New York City, various groups and individuals gathered to protest recent acts of racially motivated violence. The eclectic gathering included organizations like Brooklyn Parents for Peace, United Automobile Workers, Young Socialist Alliance, and veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of the Spanish Civil War. The protesters marched downtown, drawing attention to issues like racial bias and demanding stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by race.

**Disruption at Church Service**

Meanwhile, a separate protest disrupted a church service in Harlem, where Mayor Koch was invited to speak. A small group of hecklers, including actress Beverly Weston, who had previously disrupted a similar service in 1985, shouted insults and chants like ""Racist"" and ""Koch go home!"" The protesters' actions were met with resistance from other worshipers, who defended the Mayor and called for the disruptors to be removed. The event was already charged with political tension, as some Baptist ministers had initially opposed inviting the Mayor.

**Mayor's Visit**

During his visit to the church, Mayor Koch faced boos and heckling from the crowd, but also received support from some in attendance who defended him. In a brief speech, the Mayor emphasized the importance of unity and respect for all individuals, citing Dr. King's legacy. After the service, the Mayor visited another church, where he was met with initial enthusiasm before being criticized by some attendees for his comments on Jimmy Snyder, a TV broadcaster who lost his job after making offensive remarks about black athletes.

**Protest March**

Later that day, the protest march continued downtown, passing through Wall Street and ending at City Hall. The marchers called for Governor Cuomo to appoint a permanent special prosecutor to handle racially motivated crimes and urged the State Legislature to enact stiffer penalties for bias-motivated offenses. Representative Major R. Owens, who spoke to the demonstrators from a flatbed truck, emphasized their power as the majority and urged them to continue demanding justice.

**Corrected Information**

In a correction published on January 20, 1988, police officials revealed that actress Beverly Weston was among those disrupting the church service, having previously done so in 1985."

* Concerns expressed: Fears were raised about the impact on schools, crime, and property values.
* Opposition groups: A newly formed opposition group has vowed to fight against the project. They may hire a lawyer to challenge the proposal.

It seems like there's a mix of concerns and sentiments at play here, but overall, it appears that some people are resistant to the idea of building housing for the homeless in their community."
8801036,112747,"The article discusses a controversy surrounding a planned group home for mentally disabled individuals in Park Ridge, New Jersey. The home is to be located at 265,000-dollar house on Spring Valley Road, which is near a bar and has heavy traffic. Some neighbors are concerned about the potential impact on their property values and quality of life.

The state acquired the house from Douglas Van Horn, a Giants football player, last December. Paul Nachtigal, a stockbroker who bought a home next door seven months earlier, said that the group home will be medicating themselves, which doesn't mix well with alcohol. He also expressed concerns about the safety of the location and the ability of the residents to become fully independent.

The Mid Bergen Community Mental Health Center, which is to administer the home and provide other mental-health services for its residents, notified residents under orders from Alan Kaufman, director of the state's Division of Mental Health and Hospitals. Kaufman said that they do not want such facilities sneaking into neighborhoods under the cover of darkness.

The town of Park Ridge sued Mid Bergen and the Van Horns to prevent the sale, but the suit was dismissed in State Superior Court in Bergen County because the state's Municipal Land Use Law allows for the establishment of group homes in residential neighborhoods if they meet certain criteria. The group home must house no more than five mentally disabled people and the residents must not have a history of substance abuse or violence.

The article also discusses the benefits of group homes, citing that they provide better quality of life for the residents and are more cost-effective than hospitalization. Kaufman stressed that money was not the key consideration, but rather the well-being of the citizens.

Some neighbors are planning to meet with the residents when the group home is opened in the spring, while others plan to continue opposing the home and fighting to have the Land Use Law changed to give municipalities more input into the siting of such homes."
8801040,114037,"This is a news article about a landmark event in Yonkers, New York, where the city council voted to desegregate its schools and build public housing in white neighborhoods to remedy nearly four decades of racial discrimination.

The article reports that Judge Sand ordered the city to take these steps as part of a settlement agreement, which was reached after nearly two weeks of negotiations. The judge threatened to fine the city if it did not comply with his order, which could have left the city bankrupt.

The community leaders who led the battle against low-income housing were outraged by the council's decision and accused them of ""selling out"" the city's residents. The article quotes Jack O'Toole, one of the community leaders, as saying, ""You promised us an appeal. You promised us you'd never settle.""

The article also describes the tense atmosphere at the city council meeting, where over 800 people attended and a raucous crowd chanted slogans such as ""No Guts!,"" ""You Sold Us Out!"", and ""Resign! Resign! Resign!"". The police were present in large numbers to maintain order.

The article highlights the emotional campaigns run by some of the city council members, who had promised to fight Judge Sand's order to the Supreme Court. Two Council members, Nicholas Longo and Edward Fagan Jr., had waged highly emotional campaigns focused on promises to fight low-income housing.

Overall, this article reports on a significant event in which a city government was forced to take steps to address decades of racial discrimination, and the community leaders who fought against these changes were left feeling betrayed by the city council's decision."

* Richard Roud was forced out as director of the New York Film Festival due to ""administrative difficulties"" in October 2022.
* Joanne Koch, executive director of the Film Society, and Alfred Stern, president, were involved in the dispute that led to Roud's removal.
* The dispute centered on film selections, with Koch trying to get the committee to reverse its negative vote on certain films, including ""The Whales of August"" and Federico Fellini's ""Interview"".
* The Film Society has since appointed three of its own staff people to the selection committee: Wendy Keys (executive producer/programming), Harlan Jacobson (co-editor of Film Comment magazine), and Richard Pena (program director).
* This move has been criticized by David Denby, who fears that it will lead to a shift in the festival's tone towards more ""soft, middlebrow"" films.
* Other critics have also resigned from the selection committee in protest, including Richard Corliss, who cited concerns about the continuity of the festival and Roud's unique experience and knowledge.

8802021,117079,"The area near the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) has been plagued by gang violence and racial tensions. The murder of a Japanese woman, Miss Toshima, by black youths sparked outrage and calls for increased police presence and gang crackdowns.

However, this incident also highlighted the disparities in how law enforcement and society respond to gang-related violence depending on the race of the victims. Black communities have long complained that they are disproportionately affected by gang violence, with many innocent lives lost, yet receive little attention or support from authorities.

The article notes that while there are hundreds of youth gangs of various ethnicities, black gangs are the most violent and potent, often armed with automatic weapons and involved in the distribution of crack cocaine. The police say Los Angeles has become the gang capital of the nation, with branches of rival gangs like the Crips and Bloods spreading to other cities.

The issue of race is at the forefront of this crisis, with some black leaders arguing that society's failure to address systemic issues like poverty, lack of job opportunities, and racial bias has contributed to the problem. Others argue that harsh measures are needed to combat gang violence, including stricter controls and increased punishments for those involved in gangs.

The article highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing gang violence, one that takes into account the complex social and economic factors driving this problem, rather than just relying on police solutions."

* Involvement: Approximately 550 inmates, including those awaiting transfer to state prisons
* Grievances: Rough treatment during a search for weapons in the morning, which allegedly caused damage to their dormitories
* Tactics:
	+ Threw up barricades in 12 dormitories
	+ Broke windows and threw burning mattresses from windows
	+ Broke up as many as 600 beds to make weapons
	+ Staged protests in mess halls, including one that ripped down about four square feet of ceiling

* Injuries: Six inmates and six guards were injured
* Outcome: The disturbance was eventually brought under control by 3:30 A.M., with prisoners in the other dormitories surrendering voluntarily

* Rikers Island is overcrowded, with many state inmates awaiting transfer to upstate prisons
* City officials blame the state's slowness in claiming inmates rightfully its own for much of the tense condition in the city's jails

8802056,122416,"The Kross center on Rikers Island experienced an uprising in February 1988, where 550 inmates seized control of 12 dormitories for three and a half hours. The disturbance was caused by a weapons search on the morning of February 17, which inmates considered rough and rude. Guards slapped one sleeping prisoner, hit others, and destroyed photographs and legal papers.

The search followed the discovery of 12 homemade knives in a mess hall the day before. Seven inmates were taken to the clinic after the search, but none suffered serious injuries. The Correction Commissioner, Richard J. Koehler, said that his investigators had uncovered no cause for charges against any correction officers.

However, the Correction Board's continuing inquiry suggests that there may be substance to at least some of the inmates' charges. The board official stated that their preliminary investigation had justified a continuing examination.

The uprising was characterized by restraint on the part of guards, with no ""paybacks"" or reprisals against the inmates. Despite the chaos and damage caused by the disturbance, the inmates displayed selectivity in not targeting specific items such as television sets and telephones.

The Kross center had been experiencing crowding issues since December, leading to increased tensions among inmates. The Correction Board responded by restricting the degree of crowding and making other changes to improve the lives of inmates.

The investigation into the uprising is ongoing, but it appears that the direct cause was the weapons search, which was considered rough and rude by the inmates."

This could be seen as a form of protest or resistance against the government.
* 21: Prayer (Praying) - There is no explicit mention of prayer in the article. However, I included this category because some protesters may use prayer or other forms of spiritual expression to demonstrate their opposition to the administration's policies.

Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, saying that regional offices of the department ""are being instructed to hold off on implementation of the rule."" This could be seen as a form of holding signs or protesting against the government's actions.
* 22: Marching (Marching) - The article describes the administration's actions as ""suspended"" and ""injunction permanently prohibiting enforcement of the restriction."" This could be seen as a form of march or protest against the government."

8803030,126774,"This article reports on the resignation of Dr. Robert R. Zinser as the president of Gallaudet University, a prestigious institution for the deaf and hard of hearing. The resignation was prompted by widespread protests and demonstrations led by students and faculty members who demanded greater representation and opportunities for the deaf community.

The protesters' demands were fueled by the perception that Dr. Zinser's appointment as president was a symbol of the ""oppression"" faced by the deaf community, particularly in leadership positions. The board had included two deaf candidates among its finalists, but ultimately selected Dr. Zinser, who has been learning sign language.

The article highlights the significance of this event, noting that it has become a focal point for a national drive for greater rights and opportunities for the deaf. Protest leaders have vowed to continue their demands until all their goals are met, including the appointment of a deaf president or significant reforms to ensure greater representation on the board.

Notable quotes from the article include:

* ""We've made the first step, but we won't stop until we've gone all the way."" - Bridgetta Bourne, 20-year-old Gallaudet student and protest leader
* ""I do not accept the premise that the search process was flawed."" - Jane Bassett Spilman, chairman of the Gallaudet board

The article also mentions broad support for the protests from consumer, labor, political, and civic groups, as well as vocal backing from some members of Congress. The event has garnered national attention, with many viewing it as a ""civil rights moment in history"" for the deaf community.

3. The article highlights the challenges faced by deaf people in accessing education, employment, and other opportunities due to a lack of accommodations and understanding.
4. There is growing awareness among deaf individuals about their rights and increasing activism around issues such as employment discrimination, education access, and social inclusion.

**Protest Location:** Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, 890 square miles of desert 25 miles west of Idaho Falls.

**Reasons for Protest:**

1. The proposed Special Isotope Separation Project (SIS) would use powerful lasers to remove impurities from plutonium, a highly toxic element that is the trigger in nuclear bombs.
2. Critics argue that Idaho has made a ""grim and immoral"" bargain by accepting nuclear weapons in return for jobs and development.
3. Opponents of the plant believe that it represents a squandering of taxpayers' dollars and is not needed to make money in the state.

**Groups Involved:**

1. National antinuclear and environmental groups, including the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).
2. Idaho's labor unions.
3. Eastern Idaho's business groups.
4. Hundreds of Idaho Falls residents who have demonstrated in favor of the plant.

3. ""It's a painful topic. I wish we could find a better way to make money in this state than making bombs."" - Steve Ritchie, 42-year-old teacher from Idaho Falls.

Explanation: 
- The article is primarily about lawsuits and legal proceedings related to the Schomburg Plaza high-rise apartment house fire in Harlem, so there is no protest activity described in this article.
- However, I did find one instance of holding signs/placarding (20) as Robert Jenkins' wife Martha was burned to death in the fire."

1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (Activity 20): The article mentions that tenants demonstrated outside Governor Cuomo's office with signs and placards.
2. Sloganeering/chanting (Activity 28): Although not explicitly stated in the article, it is likely that the tenants chanted slogans during their demonstration.
3. Singing collectively (Activity 42): There is no explicit mention of singing in the article, but considering the context of a protest or demonstration, collective singing might have occurred.
4. Press Conference (Activity 34): The article mentions the lobbying effort by the tenants' group and the release of a study by the Rent Stabilization Association, which could be considered as part of a press conference."

1. The article is about an environmental group issuing a report on the most threatened national parks and advocating for changes to protect them. There are no protest activities mentioned in this part of the article.
2. Meditation (code 16) is mentioned as the Wilderness Society urges the government to end subsidies that could hurt the parks. They are not engaging in meditation themselves, but rather using a meditative tone in their advocacy.
3. Holding signs or placarding (code 20) is implied by the group's call for the federal government to remove hotels and concessions from national parks.
4. Speechmaking (code 27) is mentioned as George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, makes remarks at a news conference about the importance of protecting national parks."

* The protesters, led by lawyers Maddox and Mason, were denied access to most of the 300 supporters they brought from New York City.
* The protesters were upset about Justice Ingrassia's handling of the Tawana Brawley case and felt that he was biased against African-Americans.
* Mr. Maddox accused the court officials of deliberately denying access to the supporters, while Judge Ingrassia claimed that 40-50 seats had been set aside for journalists and the remainder would be filled on a first-come basis.
* The protesters felt that Justice Ingrassia was not providing a fair hearing and were upset about the lack of seats in the courtroom for many of the supporters who came to show their support.
* Mr. Abrams, another lawyer involved in the case, stated that Mrs. Brawley's interests were not served and that her lawyers failed to offer a defense.
* The protesters marched down the street, chanting slogans such as ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Free the land"", and stopped in front of the Social Services Department's building.

20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing: The article quotes Nini Redway, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, saying that the voter-approved law ""gives us the right to know when we're being exposed to significant cancer risks whether it's in the workplace, the supermarket or the drugstore."" This suggests that the protesters are holding signs and placards with information about the risks associated with certain products.

* **Community rally**: Neighbors, strangers, and local businesses came together to show their regret and apologize for the hate-filled incident.
* **Donations**: Over $700 was collected in donations, including a pizza with five $20 bills and notes of apology.
* **Police response**: Police Chief Kenneth R. Mancuso said the incident was ""isolated"" and not racist, but Gene L. Booth, director of the state Commission Against Discrimination, disagreed, calling it a ""racist attack.""
* **Legislative action**: The state Legislature passed a bill requiring police to record incidents of racial violence.
* **Education and awareness**: B. Jae Clanton, director of the Urban League of Rhode Island, emphasized the need for more education and better enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.

The selection process involves a standardized test, which is defended by the corporation as being academically focused. However, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest) has raised concerns about the disparities in the proportion of scholarships won by minority and female students. 

FairTest estimates that nearly two-thirds of the National Merit awards go to males, despite female students earning higher grades in high school and college. Additionally, minority groups receive a much smaller share of scholarships, even though 11% are earmarked for black and Hispanic students through specific programs.

The article suggests that the test itself may not be biased, but rather the differences in academic experiences among different groups could contribute to these disparities. The debate highlights the contentious issue surrounding the validity and use of standardized tests.

It's worth noting that FairTest has also criticized the use of standardized tests in general, releasing a report last month stating there is an excessive use of such tests by elementary and secondary school educators."

6. Local officials, including Borough President Fernando Ferrer, have voiced support for the community's efforts to keep Engine 41 open.
7. Protesters argue that the closing of Engine 41 is part of a larger plan to gentrify the neighborhood and that the area will be left vulnerable to fires without adequate firefighting services.
8. The community has also disputed the Fire Department's claims about the average response time, citing lower fire rates in recent years due to arson being brought under control.
9. If the Mayor's decision stands, protesters plan to form a human barricade to stop the engine from leaving the firehouse and may take legal action if necessary.

The article highlights the frustration and anger of New Jerseyans towards their state government, particularly regarding auto insurance costs. Two main organizers, James P. Sciallo and Samuel V. Perelli, are leading the charge through petition drives, rallies, and letter-writing campaigns.

The petition drive, led by Mr. Tomeo, aims to collect signatures in support of reducing insurance costs. This effort is seen as a way for people to express their dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs.

Meanwhile, James P. Sciallo has been organizing an auto insurance protest rally on August 27th, which will feature a dramatic display of smashing an old car with a sledgehammer to demonstrate his frustration with high insurance costs. He has also led delegations to demonstrate outside lawmakers' offices and has collected over 280,000 pieces of mail in support of reducing insurance costs.

These efforts aim to pressure the state government into taking action on reducing insurance costs. As Mr. Sciallo puts it, ""I want the lawmakers and state officials to look at their telephones and wish they weren't working."" He wants to generate as much pressure as possible to force the state government to act.

It's interesting to note that there is a proposed referendum on auto insurance, which could potentially give voters more control over the issue. Senator John H. Dorsey has introduced an insurance referendum bill, stating that ""Can anyone reasonably expect the public to continue waiting... for a real reform plan to be enacted when every promise that's been made throughout the past several years has remained unfulfilled?""

In summary, the people of New Jersey are exercising their power by organizing and protesting against high auto insurance costs. Through petitions, rallies, and letter-writing campaigns, they aim to pressure the state government into taking action on this issue."

1. Lack of information: Some adoptive parents report not receiving adequate information about a child's past abuse and neglect before adopting them, which can make it difficult to identify and address any ongoing behavioral problems.
2. Unattached children: The article mentions the concept of ""unattached children,"" who were severely abused from birth and are unable to form emotional bonds in later life. Symptoms worsen with puberty.
3. Insurance coverage: Some families find that their insurance does not cover the costs of psychological counseling or other forms of treatment for their adopted children.
4. State responsibility: Some adoptive parents feel that the state is responsible for creating the problem by hiding facts about a child's past, and they are seeking financial assistance to help them cope with the challenges of caring for these special needs children.

8808053,175241,"The protest information extracted from this news article includes:

1. **Tribal Members' Concerns**: Some Puyallup tribe members are unhappy with the new settlement, feeling it amounts to an illegal buyout of ancestral lands and continues historical abuse.

2. **Dispute Over Compensation**: The Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 provided cash payments for Alaskan Indians to settle claims on 44 million acres, but some feel this deal does not provide sufficient compensation for the Puyallup tribe's lost land and cultural heritage.

3. **Historical Context**: The Puyallup tribe surrendered millions of acres under a series of treaties in the 19th century, leading to the eventual loss of their ancestral lands.

4. **Unemployment Rate**: The Puyallup tribe has an unemployment rate of nearly 70 percent, highlighting the need for economic development and job training.

5. **Tribal Leader's Statement**: Frank Wright Jr., the tribe's administrative manager, stated that the settlement will allow them to provide for the destiny of their members.

6. **Non-Indian Property Owners' Viewpoint**: Jim Waldo, the chief negotiator for non-Indian property owners, viewed the settlement as a model for future land claims, saying costly lawsuits can be avoided through negotiations.

7. **Historical Abuse and Cultural Loss**: The article mentions historical abuse and cultural loss experienced by the Puyallup tribe, including the destruction of their salmon fishery and the occupation of their ancestral lands.

8. **Tribal Rights and Sovereignty**: The settlement includes a $22 million permanent trust fund, which will provide interest payments to tribal members, highlighting the importance of preserving tribal rights and sovereignty."

8809001,177100,"This article discusses a lawsuit filed by the Suffolk Interreligious Coalition on Housing against Brookhaven Town, alleging that the town is discriminatory in its zoning laws and practices, preventing the construction of low-to-moderate-income housing.

The lawsuit centers around two rezoning applications made by the coalition in the early 1980s for apartment complexes in Setauket and East Patchogue. The town council rejected both proposals due to opposition from civic groups and fears of increased traffic and declining property values.

Underlying the case are concerns about race, with some residents expressing fear that low-cost housing would bring in ""low-class people"" or minorities. However, fair-housing advocates argue that racial discrimination was a factor in denying the rezoning applications, as the proposed apartments would be mostly occupied by families earning between $17,000 and $28,000 a year.

The town argues that it has complied with all laws and constitutional mandates related to multi-family zoning uses and that its actions are not discriminatory. The coming trial is expected to last up to three weeks and may involve appeals, potentially taking years to resolve.

The case highlights the ongoing struggle for affordable housing in Suffolk County, where an estimated 37,000 units are needed to meet demand. It also raises questions about the intersection of race and income as factors in housing discrimination."

8809010,177562,"What an interesting case! The Kurths, a prominent family in Montana, were involved in growing marijuana on their 4,500-acre grain farm to pay off debts. While they maintained a ""high-flying"" lifestyle, even in the face of bankruptcy, many community residents feel that they should have received stiffer sentences.

The prosecutor, Tom Sheehy, has been criticized by some for not pursuing federal charges and instead opting for plea bargains. This has led to a petition drive to oust him from office, which has gathered over 960 signatures (more than the required 549).

The case highlights the complexities of drug-related offenses in rural areas, where farming is often the mainstay of the local economy. The Kurths' decision to grow marijuana was motivated by desperation and a desire to save their farm.

It's interesting to note that some community residents feel that the Kurths were treated unfairly, considering they were good people who had been exemplary citizens until this incident. The prosecutor, however, defends the plea bargains, stating ""Guilty is guilty.""

The case also raises questions about the impact of drug-related offenses on rural communities and the need for effective law enforcement strategies to address these issues.

Overall, this case highlights the complexities of drug-related offenses in rural areas and the challenges faced by prosecutors and community residents when dealing with such cases."

* 28: Sloganeering/chanting chanting same small sets of words. While there isn't explicit sloganeering in the article, it's likely that some slogans were chanted or repeated at the news conference.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing.

8809019,178389,"This article reports on a discrimination lawsuit filed by Hispanic FBI agents against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents claim that they have faced racial slurs, discriminatory treatment, and retaliation for reporting these incidents. Some notable examples include:

* Agent Louis Barragan testifying that he has heard white agents refer to Hispanic colleagues as ""lazy spics,"" ""dirty Mexicans,"" and ""lazy Mexican wetbacks.""
* New agent Alba Lorena Sierra being told by supervisors in her training that she looked ""too ethnic"" and should buy Vogue magazine for tips on hairstyles.
* 26-year veteran Bernardo M. Perez claiming that his career was sabotaged by bigots at the highest levels of the FBI.

The lawsuit alleges that Hispanic agents are not promoted at the same rate as non-Hispanic colleagues, are more likely to be assigned to dangerous undercover work, and are disciplined more frequently. The plaintiffs also claim that there is a ""taco circuit"" where Hispanic agents are sent to undesirable regions, such as Puerto Rico.

The FBI denies these allegations, citing figures showing that Hispanic agents are promoted at the same rate as non-Hispanic colleagues, if not faster. However, an outside study commissioned by the plaintiffs found evidence of discrimination and concluded that Hispanic agents receive proportionately fewer promotions to management, are more likely to be assigned to dangerous undercover work, and are disciplined more frequently.

The trial is ongoing, with a final decision expected before October 1. The lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages, as well as retroactive promotions for Hispanic agents who can prove discrimination."

3. Fear that the tower would block a view of the East River and set a precedent for further development along the waterfront.

8809043,183889,"What a fascinating article! This protest event in 1985 was a mix of zoning, religious freedom, politics, and prejudice. Here are some key points extracted from the article:

**Event:** A hearing at City Hall to decide on a proposal by the Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs) for a new tower in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.

**Turnout:** Over 1,000 Witnesses and residents attended the hearing, with many lining up as early as 6 am. The event was marked by a high level of enthusiasm and passion from both sides.

**Testimony:** 147 speakers testified, evenly divided between pro-JW and anti-JW groups. Despite the passionate arguments presented by both sides, no compromise was reached.

**Key vote:** Borough President Howard Golden's decision was crucial in determining the outcome. He voted against the proposal, citing concerns about the building's size and bulk in a historic waterfront neighborhood.

**Zoning issues:** The debate centered around whether the proposed tower would set a dangerous precedent for the area, create congestion, and block views of the Brooklyn Bridge.

**Religious freedom:** Some argued that the opposition to the JWs' proposal was rooted in religious bigotry, with one Witness lawyer stating that ""the central issue here is really civil rights and not merely a zoning matter.""

**Political influence:** Local politicians and community groups opposed the proposal, while the JWs had no voting power as they disavow political involvement. Mayor Ed Koch praised the Witnesses but also acknowledged that their lack of political clout influenced his decision.

**Outcome:** The proposal was defeated, marking a significant setback for the Jehovah's Witnesses in their efforts to expand their headquarters in Brooklyn Heights.

This event highlights the complex interplay between zoning regulations, religious freedom, and community concerns. It also underscores the challenges faced by minority groups in exercising their rights, including the JWs' struggle to balance their organizational needs with the desires of local residents."

The suit claims that Haitians were disproportionately denied residency applications and faced improper delays in the processing of their cases.

The plaintiffs argue that Haitians have been subjected to a ""tradition of hostility, prejudice, discrimination, and abuse"" by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), citing instances where Haitian applicants had their cases delayed or rejected without hearings. The suit seeks immediate decisions on all unresolved applications for residency and the reopening of some previously rejected cases.

One of the plaintiffs, Herbert Lozier, shares his personal story of fleeing political persecution in Haiti and seeking asylum in the United States. Despite applying for residency multiple times, he was repeatedly denied, leading him to feel that he cannot trust the INS.

The article notes that there are an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Haitians living in New York City, many of whom have been here legally for years but face ongoing challenges and uncertainty due to the delays and denials in their residency applications. The suit seeks to address these issues by calling for immediate decisions on all unresolved applications and the reopening of previously rejected cases.

8810010,188136,"The article discusses a court case in New York regarding a patient's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment. Mrs. O'Connor, a 77-year-old woman, was hospitalized and required a feeding tube to survive. However, she had expressed an aversion to being kept alive through artificial means and did not want the tube inserted. Her daughters, who are nurses, supported her wishes, but the hospital and attending physicians disagreed.

The Court of Appeals ruled that the patient's previous statements were not sufficient to justify withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, requiring ""clear and convincing evidence"" based solely on past expressions. This decision was seen as a blow to patients' autonomy, as it would be difficult for patients to make their wishes known in advance without specifying exact circumstances.

In his dissenting opinion, Associate Judge Richard D. Simons argued that the majority's decision trivialized Mrs. O'Connor's expressed wishes and substituted their judgment for hers. He believed that the patient had made her wishes clear and that requiring more was to upset the long-recognized principle of self-determination about medical care.

The article notes that this decision goes against the trend in other states, where courts and legislatures have affirmed patients' right to decide under similar circumstances. The case highlights the importance of advance declarations spelling out exactly what kind of treatment a patient would want withdrawn or withheld and being as specific as possible.

Some key quotes from the article include:

* ""It is the first major court to come down against patients' autonomy.""

Explanation:
1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20): The agents at the PATH communications center began yelling ""Stop that!"" through a speaker system, which can be seen as holding up signs to stop the fight.
2. Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on (27): Although there is no explicit mention of speechmaking in the article, it is implied that the authorities were prepared to take action to stop the fight, which can be seen as a form of addressing or speaking out against the violence.
3. Building Take-Over (e.g., administration building) (60): The agents at the PATH communications center took actions to try to stop the fight, including preparing to shut electrical power to the third rail if the fight continued past the turnstiles and onto the platform. This can be seen as taking over or intervening in the situation.
4. Other activity (98): There is no other specific protest activity mentioned in the article beyond these four examples."

8811054,194660,"< 20; 21; 0; 98>

Here's why I chose these categories:

* 20: Leafleting/distributing literature or tabling - The article mentions that lawyers representing more than half of the bureau's 440 Hispanic agents asked for an injunction to prevent the bureau from harassing employees who joined in the suit. This is a form of leafleting or distributing information.
* 21: Praying/worshiping - Although not explicitly mentioned, the tone of the article suggests that some kind of action or prayer may be taking place. It's likely that the Hispanic agents involved are praying for justice and fairness.
* 0: None (no other protest activities mentioned in the article) - There is no mention of any other specific protest activities beyond leafleting and possibly praying.
* 98: Other activity - The article does not specifically describe a protest activity, but rather reports on legal actions taken by the Hispanic agents involved. This category seems to fit best given the nature of the article."

1. 18 = petitioning (obtaining signatures and presenting petitions)

Explanation:
1. Petitioning: The article mentions a lawsuit filed by five black police officers, which is an example of petitioning.
2. Sloganeering/Chanting: Although not explicitly stated, the lawsuit itself could be seen as a form of sloganeering/chanting, as it is a collective effort to raise awareness and bring about change.
3. Blockade/Blocking by Protesters: Since the article does not specify any physical protest actions, this code cannot be applied directly. However, the blockade/blocking concept can be interpreted more broadly as a metaphorical ""blockade"" against discrimination and unfair treatment.
4. Other Activity: As there is no mention of any specific protest activities beyond the lawsuit filing, this category best fits the description of the situation."

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The article mentions that about 500 people demonstrated across from the Liberty Bell at Independence Mall.
* 22: Procession or marching - Although the article doesn't explicitly mention a procession, it does describe the demonstration as a gathering of people protesting against the Ku Klux Klan rally.

* Prayer/Vigil (21): Not specifically mentioned, but it's possible that some individuals may have been praying or engaging in vigilance activities related to the cases.
* Silence/No Action (26): The gag order imposed on news organizations in the Mario Biaggi case can be seen as a form of silence or no action."

4. The program will start with a small-scale distribution at the Health Department headquarters in lower Manhattan.
5. Addicts must be on a waiting list for treatment to receive needles and must turn in used needles to get new ones.

**Overall:** The article discusses the controversy surrounding New York City's needle giveaway program, which aims to reduce the spread of AIDS among drug users by providing sterile needles. Proponents argue that such programs have been successful elsewhere and can help contain the epidemic, while critics fear that it will encourage drug use and condone addiction."

Explanation:
- 1: Bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, etc. (there is no explicit mention of this in the article, but it can be inferred that there was a physical altercation involved)
- 20: Procession or marching (the two white brothers were reportedly beaten by a group of black youths while walking through the neighborhood)

8811028,198208,"This news article reports on a conference held by the National Association of Scholars (NAS), an organization composed of conservative academics who are concerned about what they perceive as liberal bias in higher education. The conference was marked by fiery rhetoric and calls to action, with speakers accusing their academic adversaries of being ""barbarians"" and advocating for a more aggressive approach to defending traditional values.

Some of the key complaints expressed at the conference included:

1. Political correctness: Many speakers accused their colleagues of allowing political objectives to contaminate academic discourse and decision-making processes.
2. Changes in curriculum: The NAS members argued that classical writers were being replaced by writers who are women or members of minority groups, and that this was part of a broader effort to undermine Western institutions.
3. Intellectual freedom: Speakers claimed that students and faculty were being subjected to ""thought reform"" and ""thought police"" for expressing views deemed insensitive or offensive.

Some notable quotes from the conference include:

* Alan C. Kors, University of Pennsylvania history professor: ""The barbarians are in our midst... We need to fight them a good long time. Show them you are not afraid, they crumble.""
* Stephen H. Balch, NAS president and executive director: ""We will try to redeem American higher education from intellectual and moral servitude to forces having little to do with the life of the mind or the transmission of knowledge.""

The article also mentions several notable NAS members, including John R. Silber, president of Boston University; Oscar Handlin, Harvard social historian; Lucy Dawidowicz, author of a major work on the Holocaust; and James Q. Wilson, political scientist.

Overall, this news article provides insight into the views and concerns of conservative academics who are pushing back against what they see as liberal dominance in higher education."

8811032,198976,"The numeric answer is: 17; 28; 29; 98.

Explanation:

* 17: The article describes lawyers asking for a special prosecutor to investigate police brutality allegations, which can be seen as a form of ""parading chariots"" in the sense that they are presenting their case and demands to the court.
* 28: Sloganeering/chanting is relevant here because some of the complainants may have chanted slogans or repeated phrases related to racial justice and police accountability during protests or rallies.
* 29: Vigiling refers to holding placards, banners, or engaging in silent protest, which might be a way for these individuals to demonstrate their discontent with the current situation and demand change.
* 98: Other activity - This answer is because none of the other categories seem to apply directly. There is no mention of specific forms of artistic expression (33), musical performances (36), or dramatic presentations (10).

2. Describing Project (code 50): Although not explicitly stated, the article's description of the incident and the investigation can be seen as a way of describing the project or cause being protested (i.e., racial bias).
3. Other activity (code 98): This code is used to indicate that there are other protest activities mentioned in the article that do not fit into any of the previously listed categories.
4. Missing activity (code 99): This code is used when no specific protest activity is mentioned in the article, but it can be inferred that some form of protest or demonstration may have taken place."
8811042,201552,"Based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities as follows:

1. 26; 27; 28 = silence, speechmaking, sloganeering/chanting (referenced in the quote ""By her past actions and pronouncements, Barbara Harris promises to be a regular source of division in the church'' and later in the article where people are mentioned as having raised objections to Ms. Harris's political views and theological positions)

Note: There may be other protest activities not explicitly mentioned in the article but implied through the language used, such as demonstrations or rallies, which could potentially be categorized under 26 (silence) or 28 (sloganeering/chanting)."
8811044,201845,"This article reports on the ongoing protest by farm workers against the use of pesticides in grape production. The union has been calling for a boycott of grapes since 1984 to pressure growers to stop using five specific pesticides: Captan, methyl bromide, phosdrin, parathion, and Dinoseb. The protest gained momentum this summer when Cesar Chavez, the farm union president, went on a hunger strike for 36 days.

Key points from the article:

1. Despite the boycott, grape consumption has actually increased by 16.9% nationwide since 1984.
2. Some California grocery chains have started certifying that their grapes meet government standards through inspections by private companies like NutriClean.
3. The farm union claims that people are more aware of pesticides due to the protest and hunger strike, which has led to a slight increase in support for the boycott.
4. However, industry representatives see the boycott as a desperate attempt by a declining union, and some question the motives behind the protest.
5. Testing by state and federal agencies has found residues of certain pesticides to be below tolerance levels, but farm workers argue that the tolerance levels are too high and not enough grapes are tested.

Overall, the article suggests that while the boycott may have gained some momentum, it is still facing significant challenges in terms of public awareness and support."

3. Silence/Silent worship (26): Although not explicitly mentioned, the fact that they sang Christmas carols and hymns implies a sense of silence or quiet contemplation.

8812006,204117,"This article discusses a controversy surrounding a proposal by WestHELP, an organization run by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, to build 108 units of housing for the homeless in Mayfair-Knollwood, a section of Greenburgh, New York. The residents of Mayfair-Knollwood have been vocal in their opposition to the project, citing concerns about crime, property values, and the character of their neighborhood.

The controversy has escalated into a debate about the civil rights of minorities and the homeless, with some critics accusing the proponents of incorporation (the formation of a new village) of racism and bigotry. The town supervisor, Anthony Veteran, rejected the group's petition for incorporation, citing what he called an ""invidious purpose"" - namely, opposition to the homeless project.

The debate has also highlighted concerns about the distribution of social services and resources in the region, with some arguing that the burden of responsibility should be shared more equitably among suburban communities. The article notes that other towns in Westchester County, such as Mount Pleasant and Mount Vernon, have already approved similar proposals for homeless housing, while Greenburgh's Town Board has approved a project for Mayfair-Knollwood.

The controversy has also sparked concerns about the potential consequences of secession and the formation of new villages. Some critics argue that the creation of new villages could lead to a fragmentation of responsibility and resources, with each village seeking to protect its own interests at the expense of others.

In the end, the article suggests that the controversy is not just about the homeless project itself, but also about broader issues of social justice, community identity, and the distribution of resources in suburban communities."
8812007,204322,"Here is my response:

; 20; 27; 98

Explanation:

* : The article mentions that an environmental group filed a suit against the Defense Department, which is a protest activity involving legal action.
* : The article states that the Foundation on Economic Trends and its president, Jeremy Rifkin, are behind the lawsuit, which involves asking for votes or signatures in this case.
* : The article reports on a statement by Maj. Richard Bridges, an Army spokesman, who spoke about the importance of safety and the environment, which is a form of public speaking or speechmaking.

Here's my reasoning:

* 28: Sloganeering/Chanting - The doctors and representatives of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War are urging President-elect Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to grant the panel ""the widest possible access to information."" This can be interpreted as a call to action, encouraging others to join in and chant slogans.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The article mentions that the doctors have sent letters to President-elect Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev asserting that recent disclosures about safety hazards at nuclear weapon plants had stimulated concern. This can be seen as a form of placarding or holding signs, raising awareness about the issue.
* 16: Meditation, ordinarily silent, silent meditation service - The article does not explicitly mention meditation, but it does highlight the concern and urgency surrounding the production of nuclear weapons. A peaceful protest involving silent meditation could be an effective way to demonstrate this concern.
* 98: Other activity - This code refers to any protest activities that do not fit into the previously listed categories. In this case, I'm including the commission's efforts to assess public health hazards and measure the link between radioactive releases at a nuclear weapon manufacturing site and cancer rates and genetic defects among plant workers and local populations as an ""other"" activity, as it does not fit neatly into any of the other categories."

2. Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on (27): Rabbi Haskel Lookstein spoke about the plight of Soviet Jews, and Franklin Smiles explained that the message should reach Americans.
3. Sloganeering/chanting chanting same small sets of words (28): The Estonian group chanted, ""One, two, three, four, open up the iron door.""
4. Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters signature (18): Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, the protest activity is implied as protesters gathered to demonstrate their support for Soviet Jews and other groups."

2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (#20): Students held signs and protested the new curriculum.
3. Looting: Although not directly mentioned in the article, I assume that students might have taken over a school administration building (mentioned under #60) or occupied some other space without permission, which could be considered as looting (#61).

Here's my breakdown:

1. Vigiling (silent protest holding placards/banners): The article mentions that six Indian inmates are suing for the right to build sweat lodges at the state prison, which could be seen as a form of silent protest or vigil.

2. Petitioning (obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions/letters): The lawsuit filed in March 1987 is an example of petitioning, where the plaintiffs are seeking to have their rights recognized and protected through legal means.

3. Holding signs/picket line/placarding: The article mentions that the plaintiffs' attorney, Danny Quintana, hoped that newly elected Attorney General Paul Van Dam would be more flexible and seek to settle the issue out of court, which could be seen as a form of holding signs or picketing for attention and support.

Explanation: 
The article discusses a protest by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission due to its lack of representation from black people and women. The NAACP is calling for boycotts, picketing, and other forms of protest until their demands are met.

1. Bannering: There is no mention of bannering in this article.
2. Bell Ringing: Not mentioned.
3. Picketing: This is the main form of protest mentioned in the article.
4. Sit-ins: Not mentioned.
5. Petitions: Not specifically mentioned, but the NAACP's demands are presented as a concerted effort to express blacks' frustration and disgust over the commission's makeup and demand that blacks and women be on it.
6. Boycotts: Mentioned as one of the forms of protest being called for by the NAACP.

Therefore, I classified this article as 1 ; 20 ; 28 ; 98>."

Note: Since there are no specific protest activities mentioned in the article, I have coded the first two answers as ""Missing activity"" (99) and ""Other activity"" (98), respectively. The last two answers are zero because there is no evidence of any peaceful assembly or collective public activity in the article."

* <numeric answer 1> : No specific activity mentioned, so I left it blank (1).
* <numeric answer 2> : Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20). The inmates' protest was not explicitly described as holding signs, but the phrase ""making sure officials knew how miserable they were"" implies a form of protest or demonstration.
* <numeric answer 3> : Withholding obligations (e.g., refusing to go to school, work, pay rent or utilities or taxes, obey the draft); The inmates' actions, such as burning mattresses and damaging electrical and ductwork, can be seen as a form of withholding their normal behavior or compliance with rules.
* <numeric answer 4> : Missing activity (99). There is no specific fourth protest activity mentioned in the article."
8812031,210554,"Based on the article, I would code the protest activities as follows:

< 20 ; 25 ; 28 ; 31>

These activities are mentioned in the article: 

1. Holding signs (picket line, placarding): The article mentions that police have been enforcing laws against littering and being in public parks after dark, which has resulted in the arrest of some homeless individuals.
2. Canvassing, asking for votes, signatures, money, opinions: This activity is not explicitly mentioned in the article, but it can be inferred that advocates for the homeless are canvassing or soliciting support for their cause.
3. Sloganeering/chanting: Some of the homeless individuals quoted in the article express slogans such as ""We're saying parades and football are more important than our fellow human beings"" to highlight their grievances.
4. Public charity work: The article mentions that private charities provide most of the sheltering for the homeless, which can be seen as a form of public charity work.

1 ; 20 ; 97 ; 98

Here's my reasoning:

* 1: The Jehovah's Witnesses' actions can be considered a form of ""bannering"" (category 1), as they surrounded Mrs. Nicoleau's bed and refused to allow a transfusion.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (category 20): Although there is no specific mention of holding signs or banners in the article, their actions can be interpreted as a form of protest and refusal to accept medical treatment.
* 97: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers such as a trial, filing brief, and son on (category 97): The hospital had obtained a court order for the transfusion earlier Friday, which suggests that the authorities may have taken legal action in response to the protest.
* 98: Other activity (category 98): This category is broad enough to encompass any other forms of protest or activism that are not specifically mentioned in the article."

* Skinheads, a youth subculture, have been involved in violent attacks across the nation.
* They have joined forces with old-line racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups to commit racist violence, including beatings, stabbings, and killings.
* The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith estimates that only about 2,500 actively racist skinheads exist nationwide, concentrated in 21 states.
* However, the organization notes that thousands of skinheads exist nationwide, making them a fertile ground for recruiting by racist and anti-Semitic groups.
* Racist and neo-Nazi organizations like the White Aryan Resistance are actively recruiting skinheads into their movements.
* The Anti-Defamation League warns that New York City is not immune to the racist variety of skinheadism.
* Skinheads in New York have organized into groups like SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice) and others, but even nonracist skinheads acknowledge the ease with which some can be recruited into racism.

Here's how I arrived at these answers:

1. Code 20: ""Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing."" The article mentions that over 125 demonstrators showed up to the event, implying a visible display of support for the cause through holding signs or placards.
2. Code 22: ""Procession or marching."" Although it's not explicitly stated in the article, the demonstration is described as taking place at the site where the nuclear plant is located, which suggests that the protesters may have marched to the location before being arrested.
3. Code 18: ""Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters signature."" Although there is no mention of specific petitioning activities in the article, the fact that the protest was held to demonstrate against the restarting of the nuclear plant implies an attempt to gather support and present a unified opposition to this decision.
4. Code 97: ""Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers such as a trial, filing brief, and so on."" Although it's not explicitly stated in the article, the fact that 27 people were arrested on trespassing charges suggests that there may be legal challenges or lawsuits arising from these arrests."

8901038,213639,"This article discusses two studies on racial disparities in medical care. The first study, conducted by Dr. Mark B. Wenneker and Dr. Arnold M. Epstein, analyzed hospital records in Massachusetts and found that black patients were less likely to receive cardiac procedures such as coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and angiography compared to white patients. Even after controlling for various factors, the researchers found that whites were 89% more likely to have coronary bypasses, 29% more likely to have angiographies, and 70% more likely to have angioplasties.

The second study, conducted by a team of researchers from Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California at Los Angeles, used national survey data to examine racial disparities in medical care. The study found that blacks were less likely than whites to visit physicians, with 37% of blacks not having visited a doctor in the past year compared to 32% of whites. The study also found that blacks had lower rates of medical insurance coverage and were more likely to use clinics and emergency rooms.

The studies suggest that racial disparities exist in the provision of cardiac care in Massachusetts and that black patients are less likely than white patients to receive certain medical procedures. The findings raise concerns about unequal access to health care and highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying causes of these disparities.

Key points:

* Black patients in Massachusetts were less likely to receive cardiac procedures such as coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and angiography compared to white patients.
* Even after controlling for various factors, whites were more likely than blacks to receive these procedures.
* Blacks were less likely than whites to visit physicians, with 37% of blacks not having visited a doctor in the past year compared to 32% of whites.

8901079,217264,"**Execution of Ted Bundy**

Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer, was executed by electric chair at Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989. He died at 7:16 AM after receiving 2,000 volts of electricity for one minute.

The execution was attended by a crowd outside the prison gates, who cheered and whistped when a signal was sent from the cellblock indicating that Bundy was dead. The crowd had gathered to witness the event, which marked the end of Bundy's appeals and his final chance to escape justice.

Bundy's death sentence was carried out on the fourth warrant issued by Florida Governor Bob Graham. He was convicted of murdering 12-year-old Kimberly Leach in 1978 and two Florida State University students who were bludgeoned and strangled while sleeping in their beds.

In the days leading up to his execution, Bundy confessed to at least 16 other killings, including some that had not been previously linked to him. He also implicated himself in a dozen or more similar crimes committed across several Western states.

Despite his guilty pleas and confessions, Bundy maintained until the end of his life that he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. His lawyers argued that he was the victim of ""conniving investigators"" who had woven a web of circumstantial evidence to convict him.

The execution of Ted Bundy marked the end of a chapter in American criminal history, and many people felt a sense of relief and closure. However, the case also raised questions about the motivations behind Bundy's crimes and the psychology of serial killers.

**Psychological Analysis**

Dr. David Abrahamsen, a psychiatrist who has studied serial killers, theorized that Bundy's crimes were motivated by a deep-seated hatred of women and a desire for power and control. He believed that Bundy's actions were a form of revenge against his mother and society in general.

Bundy himself had previously hinted at the role of alcohol in his mood swings and had confessed to being driven by strong and repeated fantasies of revenge and power. Some experts believe that Bundy's crimes were linked to his childhood experiences and his relationships with women, while others see them as a manifestation of his own psychological disturbances.

Regardless of the motivations behind his crimes, Ted Bundy's execution brought closure to the families of his victims and marked the end of a dark chapter in American criminal history."

8902012,219654,"The spotlight is now shining on Mr. MacDonald, Chairman of the Navajo Nation, and his business dealings are under scrutiny. The Congressional inquiry is investigating allegations of favoritism and mismanagement, particularly with regards to the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in 1987.

Mr. MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing and claims that the inquiry is taking a wrong turn by examining tribal government rather than just allegations of mismanagement by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. However, critics argue that he wields enormous power over the reservation, which spreads across northeastern Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, and controls access to health care, housing, jobs, and business opportunities.

The inquiry has raised questions about the tribe's purchase of the 750,000-acre Big Boquillas Ranch for $33.4 million, which is $8 million more than its advertised price. Two middlemen in the deal were old friends of Mr. MacDonald's, adding to the suspicion of favoritism.

Critics have also pointed out that Mr. MacDonald spent $650,000 on a remodeling project for his office suite, including engraved doors that cost $4,800. He has also flown 47 tribal council delegates to Washington for the inauguration of President Bush and set up an office for his wife, Wanda, at a cost of $70,000.

Despite these criticisms, Mr. MacDonald remains popular among many Navajos, particularly older, traditional ones, due to the cultural norm of favoritism towards relatives in clan life. His supporters argue that he has brought new jobs and business opportunities to the reservation, including shopping malls and manufacturing facilities.

However, detractors claim that many of these efforts have failed, such as the closure of Mechanical Specialisties Inc., which made brake parts in Shiprock, N.M., and Levi Strauss Co.'s cancellation of a manufacturing contract due to poor workmanship. The questionable ranch purchase is also under scrutiny, with questions about why it was bought at an inflated price.

The inquiry has sparked concerns about Mr. MacDonald's leadership and whether he should remain in office. A movement has begun to remove him from his position, which carries an annual salary of $55,000. It remains to be seen how the inquiry will unfold and what actions will be taken as a result."

**Protest Against Standardized Tests**

A court has ruled that standardized achievement tests used to determine admission to colleges and graduate schools discriminate against girls. The decision is a major victory for critics of the testing system, which has been widely criticized.

**Challenges Expected**

The ruling is expected to open the door to challenges against many current uses of standardized tests. Critics of the testing companies believe that this decision will encourage attacks on the tests.

**Prejudices and Biases**

Experts have noted that women do not do as well as men on many standardized tests, with boys consistently outscoring girls. The differing scores are attributed to various factors, including sex bias in the questions, social pressures, and differences in brain functions between the sexes.

**Call for Reform**

The decision has sparked calls for reform of the testing system, with some arguing that it is unfair to base scholarships on a single three-hour test taken on a Saturday afternoon. Others have suggested using high school grades as a more accurate measure of academic achievement.

**Impact on Admissions**

The ruling may impact admissions processes at colleges and graduate schools, which currently rely heavily on standardized tests. Some experts believe that the decision could lead to a shift towards considering multiple factors in admission decisions, rather than relying solely on test scores."

8902064,225475,"The protest surrounding Salman Rushdie's book ""The Satanic Verses"" has led to widespread international support for the author. The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, issued a statement appealing for an end to threats against Rushdie's life and human rights.

As a result of the protests, several authors and publishing figures have come out in support of Rushdie, including Norman Mailer, Gay Talese, E.L. Doctorow, and Robert K. Massie, president of the Authors Guild. The Writers Guild of America, East, has also appealed to book chains to restore ""The Satanic Verses"" to their shelves.

In the United States, 17 Roman Catholic writers, including William Kennedy, Maureen Howard, Garry Wills, and Rev. Andrew Greeley, have written a letter critical of statements by John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York. The letter notes that while the Cardinal expressed sympathy for Muslims, he did not speak out against the threats against Rushdie's life.

The protest has also led to increased security measures being taken to protect Rushdie and his family. His wife, Marianne Wiggins, has been forced to go into hiding due to the threats, and Rushdie himself has been unable to leave his home.

The reaction of nations to the book is varied. In Canada, a government agency has halted imports of the book pending review, while in France, the rights holder has suspended plans to publish the book. In Germany, the publisher has temporarily suspended its plans to publish the book.

Despite the threats and the controversy surrounding the book, some booksellers have reported that their customers have complimented them for having the courage to carry and sell the novel."

1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (Code 20): The two black House members who walked out when Mr. Duke was sworn in are an example of holding signs or protesting through their actions.
2. Sloganeering/chanting (Code 28): Representative C.D. Jones' warning that ""we will be keeping an eye on him"" can be seen as a form of sloganeering, and the lawmakers who rose to object to the swearing-in were likely chanting anti-Duke slogans.
3. Speechmaking (Code 27): The lawmakers who took turns at the microphone to warn Mr. Duke are an example of speechmaking, as they were expressing their opposition and concerns about his presence in the Legislature.
4. Other activity (Code 98): The article does not specify any other protest activities beyond these four, so I coded this one as ""Other activity""."
8902050,226318,"This article reports on a lawsuit brought by two men, Theodore Donaldson and Charles Coull, who are threatened with eviction from their homes in New York City. The lawsuit, called Donaldson v. Cuomo, seeks to extend the right to counsel that the United States Supreme Court has recognized in criminal cases for almost 26 years, beginning with the landmark case of Gideon v. Wainwright.

The plaintiffs argue that they have defenses they would like to raise against eviction, but are unable to afford private counsel and have been told that the Legal Aid Society and similar services are too burdened to take on eviction cases. They request a court-appointed lawyer, but this was denied in Mr. Donaldson's case and granted in Mr. Coull's case, with no lawyer being assigned.

The lawsuit is brought on behalf of two tenants' organizations and ""all poor tenants residing in the City of New York who are defending or will defend summary eviction proceedings in Housing Court and who do not have counsel."" The named defendants include Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Edward I. Koch, and judges who either supervise the court or handled the requests of the plaintiffs.

The lawsuit argues that the right to counsel is guaranteed by the United States Constitution, the New York State Constitution, and a state statute that lets judges decide whether to appoint lawyers for indigent people in civil matters. However, it notes that this statute does not provide a way to match lawyers with those who need them.

A five-judge panel of the State Supreme Court will take up the case on May 11.

The article also discusses the issue of unequal representation in the Housing Court, where landlords often have lawyers while tenants do not. This can result in evictions and homelessness for low-income families. The lawsuit seeks to address this issue by extending the right to counsel to indigent tenants facing eviction.

Some experts interviewed for the article argue that the current system is unfair and that the right to counsel should be extended to include civil cases like eviction proceedings. Others suggest that the private bar should volunteer to represent poor tenants, but this would likely require significant funding.

Overall, the lawsuit seeks to address a longstanding issue of unequal representation in the Housing Court and to ensure that indigent tenants have access to legal representation when facing eviction."

President Bush's campaign rhetoric on environmental protection had raised expectations that he would take bold action on this issue.

However, Bush's initial response to the disaster was cautious, which drew criticism from environmental groups. The accident has reinforced concerns about man-made disasters and natural calamities, such as droughts and heat waves, which have contributed to a growing sense of unease about the environment.

The article notes that several Democratic candidates used environmental issues effectively in the 1986 elections, and that Republicans are vulnerable on this issue. Bush's promise to be ""the environmental President"" has been tested by his response to the Valdez disaster, and his decision not to take more significant action has disappointed some of his supporters.

The article also highlights the impact of the disaster on public opinion, with many Americans becoming increasingly concerned about the environment and the potential risks associated with it.

The march was sparked by the fear that the Supreme Court would overturn or significantly restrict the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion in the United States.

The march featured prominent feminist leaders, including Gloria Steinem and Faye Wattleton, as well as ordinary women and men who were passionate about protecting women's rights to make their own reproductive choices. The event was marked by a sense of urgency and frustration among the participants, who felt that the anti-abortion movement had gained too much traction in recent years.

The marchers carried signs and banners with messages such as ""My body, my baby, my business"" and ""Keep your laws off my body."" Many women brought their children to participate in the march, emphasizing that this was a family issue. The event also drew counter-protesters who were opposed to abortion rights, including some dressed as babies who shouted ""What about the babies?""

The article highlights the personal stories of many participants, including those who had experienced illegal abortions before Roe v. Wade or had lost loved ones due to lack of access to legal abortion services. The event was marked by moments of emotional intensity and urgency, with many speakers invoking the legacy of Norma McCorvey, also known as Jane Roe, who brought the landmark lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court's decision.

The crowd was diverse, with participants of all ages, including mothers, fathers, and children. Many attendees wore white, purple, and gold, the colors of the women's suffrage movement, as a symbol of their support for reproductive rights.

The march was led by feminist leaders, including Gloria Steinem, who spoke about the need to affirm that women are full citizens with the right to make their own decisions about their bodies. Representative Patricia Schroeder also spoke, emphasizing the importance of standing up against attempts to restrict women's rights.

The event drew counter-protesters from the anti-abortion movement, who held signs and shouted slogans such as ""What about the babies?"" The two groups clashed at times, with some shouting matches occurring along the march route. However, the majority of participants remained peaceful and focused on their message of support for abortion rights.

Throughout the weekend, speakers shared personal stories and testimonials about the importance of reproductive freedom. Many attendees brought their children to the march, emphasizing that this was a family issue. The event also featured performances by celebrities such as Jane Fonda and Marlo Thomas.

1. **Protest issue:** The fishermen's association is protesting the New York City's plan to use the Chelsea pumping station to withdraw water from the Hudson River, which they claim will harm the reservoir and its ecosystem.
2. **Violations of Clean Water Act:** The fishermen are asking the judge to fine New York City $25,000 a day for each violation of the Clean Water Act, citing the city's operation of the Chelsea pumping station in 1985 without proper permits or environmental assessments.
3. **Environmental damage:** The fisherman's association claims that the alum used in the West Branch Reservoir has destroyed the reservoir bottom as a ""functioning ecosystem"" and caused reduced growth and reproductive impairment to fish in the reservoir.
4. **Request for injunction:** The fishermen are seeking an injunction to prevent the reopening of the Chelsea pumping station, which they claim will cause further environmental damage.
5. **Concerns about striped bass stock:** Dr. Richard Ian Fletcher, a fisheries expert, testified that the Chelsea pumping station will add to the diminishment of the striped bass stock caused by power companies located at the river's edge.
6. **Request for delay:** The fisherman's association is asking the city to delay its start-up date for the pumping station, citing concerns about the impact on young striped bass during their most sensitive stage of development.

These protests are highlighting the potential environmental and ecological risks associated with the city's plan to withdraw water from the Hudson River."

8904039,244336,"This news article reports on the Supreme Court's consideration of an abortion case from Missouri, where the state has enacted a law restricting access to abortions. The Court is re-examining the constitutional basis for the right to abortion and considering whether it can be limited to abortion or if it would have broader implications for the entire constitutional privacy doctrine.

The article highlights the debate between Justice Antonin Scalia and Frank Susman, the lawyer representing Reproductive Health Services, a Missouri abortion clinic. Justice Scalia questioned the reliance on faith in determining when life begins, while Mr. Susman emphasized that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one that should be left to the individual.

The article also notes that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has been closely watched due to her perceived influence on the Court's decisions regarding abortion. Her questioning during the argument suggested some uncertainty about the government's ability to require women to have abortions if there was an overpopulation problem in the future.

The case attracted significant attention, with 78 friend-of-court briefs filed by advocacy organizations, public officials, scientists, doctors, historians, and other groups. A decision is expected before the current term in late June or early July."
8904042,244798,"This article describes a protest movement led by high school students in West Milford, New Jersey, against the use of polystyrene products (foam trays) in their schools. The students, prompted by their social studies teacher Karl Stehle, began a campaign to stop the use of foam trays and switch to paper trays. They conducted a survey among their classmates, which showed that 86% of high school students and 92% of middle school students were willing to pay extra for paper trays.

The students then put their words into action by buying lunch on paper trays instead of foam trays for a week. This led to a significant increase in support, with 72% of high school students and 86% of middle school students paying the extra nickel.

As a result of the student's campaign, the Board of Education stopped using foam trays in township schools, and the township council suggested using paper trays in all township buildings. The students' efforts also inspired a letter-writing campaign to other schools in New Jersey, with many responding that they did not use plastic or were willing to follow West Milford's lead.

The article highlights the impact of the students' actions, including visits from local officials and recognition at an International Youth Environmental Forum at the United Nations. The students' leader, Miss Vogt, emphasizes the importance of believing in oneself and taking action to bring about change."

Explanation:
1. Meditation, ordinarily silent (16): The article mentions that Exxon's response to the accident is being criticized, and that Exxon has apologized for the spill. This could be seen as a form of meditation or silence.
2. Petitioning, both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters signature (18): The six consumer and environmental groups are calling for a national boycott of all products made by Exxon, which involves petitioning or gathering support from others.
3. Public protest, including boycotting, cutting credit cards in half, and sending them back to the company (20): Consumers are being asked to refrain from buying Exxon gasoline and other products until the company meets certain demands. This is a form of public protest.
4. Issue-based activism or advocacy (26): The article highlights the criticism of Exxon's response to the accident, as well as the demand for changes in how the company operates, including establishing a trust fund for environmental protection and rolling back recent gasoline price increases."
8905007,246653,"This article discusses the growing concern over the impact of HIV/AIDS on women. Key points include:

1. About 7,000 women in the US have been diagnosed with AIDS, accounting for around 10% of all AIDS patients.
2. Women are often invisible in the AIDS epidemic, and their concerns have not been adequately addressed.
3. New support groups are needed to address the specific needs of women affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly low-income women who may be in abusive relationships or involved with drug users.
4. Many women learn they are infected with HIV when their babies develop AIDS, highlighting the need for prenatal testing and counseling.
5. Women face significant barriers to protecting themselves against HIV, including difficulty persuading sexual partners to use condoms and fear of violence if they bring up the issue.
6. The majority of American women diagnosed with AIDS (about 75%) are from minority groups.
7. The rapid spread of HIV among women is alarming, with a steady increase in the proportion of AIDS cases among women since the early 1980s.

Quotes from experts and advocates include:

* Timothy J. Sweeney: ""We don't want to see women have to go through what gay men have been going through.""
* Marie St. Cyr (director of WARN): ""It's a very shaky situation for women... They often have difficulty persuading sexual partners to use condoms, and some women face the threat of violence if they even broach the issue.""
* Mathilde Krim: ""We are seeing waves of infections... First we saw a wave of men - gays and hemophiliacs and drug abusers. Now they have infected women, and we are seeing a wave of infections in women.""
* Dr. Mary E. Guinan: ""The trend is continuing. We don't know what is happening now, but I would venture to say that the trend is continuing.""

2. The event itself can be considered a form of silence, as the crowd gave a standing ovation and cheered Mr. North without making any loud noise.
3. Oliver North's speechmaking is evident throughout the article, where he criticized Congress, made indirect references to his legal situation, and called for financial support for Joseph Fernandez.

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - Vietnam Veterans of America's president Mary Stout is quoted saying that this is a ""major victory with far-reaching implications."" This suggests that there may be protests or rallies with people holding signs and expressing their views.
* 28: Sloganeering/chanting - The article mentions that the veterans' group will again sponsor legislation, which implies some form of chanting or sloganeering to promote their cause.
* 97: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers such as a trial, filing brief, and so on - The article is primarily about a lawsuit being thrown out by a Federal district judge, which suggests that the main protest activity here is filing lawsuits and appealing court decisions."

The proposal has angered both landlords and tenants, with some tenant groups calling it a ""fait accompli"" (done deal).

Key points:

1. The RGI proposes rent increases of 6.7% for leases signed between October 1989 and September 1990.
2. Landlords claim the board did not fully consider their hardships, while tenants argue that the majority of the panel is biased against them.
3. The proposed renewal rates are slightly higher than last year's increases (6% and 9%).
4. Tenants' advocates maintain that many landlords do not provide the services they are required to by law.
5. The board also proposes a 10% increase in rent for vacant apartments and those with changing tenants.
6. Two tenant representatives on the board, Harriet Cohen and Stephen Dobkin, resigned in protest before the vote.
7. The RGI voted 5-2 to propose the 6.1/2 and 9.1/2 percent increases.
8. Landlords argue that the rent control has led to low returns, while tenants claim that the proposed increases will lead to exorbitant rents.

* White students at colleges and universities feel that affirmative action is a special privilege provided to black students, while they struggle to pay high tuition costs.
* Over the last three years, there have been episodes of racist graffiti, jokes, hate notes, and brawls at 175 campuses, including top private colleges and public universities.
* Targets of intolerance include not only blacks but also homosexuals, Hispanic people, Jews, Asians, and whites.
* The recent clashes between black and white students on campus have interrupted academic routines and prompted some administrators to alter hiring policies and curriculums.
* The incidents have led to calls for greater vigilance and a renewed focus on affirmative action, with some universities revising their codes of acceptable behavior to establish clearer grounds for punishing those responsible for racial harassment.
* Some white students feel resentful towards special programs that give preference to minority students over white students who may have higher grades or standardized test scores.
* The formation of a White Student Union at Temple University is an extreme example of discontent, with some members claiming that affirmative action is ""reverse racism"" and that they are being excluded from opportunities based on their race.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""Universities are fragile institutions. Like a nice watch, the smallest amount of dust can stop it, and people have discovered how vulnerable we are."" - Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University
* ""A lot of people thought Smith was a great place, and they can't understand why change has to take place."" - Laura Bernebey, former editor of the campus newspaper Sophian
* ""White people are being discriminated against by affirmative action. We feel that giving scholarships, jobs or anything else because of race is wrong and they should be given on merit alone."" - Michael Spletzer, president of the White Student Union at Temple University

* 26: Silence (reference to community's pain and struggles) - The article mentions that the community has been affected by negative publicity and struggles with issues like drug abuse and prostitution.

The group plans to hold demonstrations in front of the White House on Monday and present President Bush with a letter of protest.

The article highlights the shocking accounts of violence filtering in from Beijing, where the Communist government has cracked down on pro-democracy protesters. Chinese students in the United States are horrified by the reports of brutality and killings, which have been shared with them through telephone calls from relatives and friends in Beijing.

One student, Zheng Ling, reported that soldiers poured gasoline on the demonstrators and burned them after surrounding a last group of several thousand protesters in Tiananmen Square. This version was corroborated by other students who received similar accounts from their friends and family members in China.

The article also provides some context about the power struggle within the Communist Party of China, with Yang Shangkun, an 82-year-old state President, believed to be a leader of the party's old guard. Mr. Yang is thought to be skeptical of the economic changes instituted by Deng Xiaoping and may have increased his influence as a result of the crackdown.

The report emphasizes the importance of intimacy and autonomy in education, recommending smaller school sizes, increased student-adult interaction, and more flexible learning environments.

Some specific recommendations made by the report include:

* Creating ""schools within schools"" with 200-300 students
* Assigning every student an adult adviser who takes the time to talk to them
* Building on adolescents' preoccupation with social relationships by allowing small groups of students to work together on projects
* Organizing teachers into interdisciplinary teams that have discretion to modify curricula and schedules based on changing student needs
* Encouraging volunteer work and other means of getting students involved in the community

The report also criticizes the practice of tracking, which it describes as ""one of the most divisive and damaging school practices in existence."" Instead, the report suggests using techniques like peer tutoring to promote learning and socialization.

Additionally, the report rejects the notion that early adolescence is a time when little serious education can occur, citing research that shows young adolescents are capable of complex thought.

8906041,261405,"This article is not about a protest or an event specifically related to AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), but rather it provides a historical context and reflection on the Stonewall riots, which occurred in 1969. The article highlights how the riots marked a turning point in the gay rights movement and led to significant changes in laws and societal attitudes towards homosexuality.

The article quotes several individuals who were involved in the gay liberation front and ACT UP, including Martin Robinson, Virginia Apuzzo, Thomas B. Stoddard, and Michael Scherker. These individuals reflect on the events leading up to Stonewall, the riots themselves, and the aftermath, which saw significant changes in laws and societal attitudes towards homosexuality.

Some of the key points mentioned in the article include:

* The Stonewall Inn was a black-walled bar owned by organized crime that was raided by police for violations of liquor laws.
* The riot that followed was not initially about gay rights, but rather a spontaneous reaction to the police bullying and harassment.
* Since Stonewall, there have been significant changes in laws and societal attitudes towards homosexuality, including the passage of anti-discrimination statutes, the invalidation or repeal of sodomy laws, and increased visibility and acceptance of gay people.
* The focus of the gay rights movement has shifted from the courts to politics, with gay activists gaining access to policy-makers and becoming more influential in political campaigns.

8907007,263532,"The Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the Missouri statute restricting abortion is a significant blow to the right to abortion in the United States. The ruling is expected to lead to further restrictions on abortion at the state level, with opponents of abortion looking forward to the next term when they expect the court to uphold further restrictions embodied in statutes in Illinois, Minnesota, and Ohio.

The decision has sparked strong reactions from both sides of the debate, with supporters of abortion rights condemning the ruling as a ""wrenching reversal"" that will make it harder for women to access abortion services. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, said the ruling ""signals that women's equality and their right to privacy are in danger.""

On the other hand, opponents of abortion hailed the decision as a victory, with Archbishop John May of St. Louis, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, saying it was ""a big step toward overturning Roe v. Wade."" President Bush welcomed the decision, stating that it ""appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn.""

The ruling is likely to lead to a political firestorm at the state level, with advocates of abortion rights planning to mobilize against further restrictions on abortion. The National Abortion Rights Action League plans to involve itself heavily in this year's gubernatorial election in New Jersey, where Representative Jim Courter, the Republican nominee, opposes abortion and James J. Florio, the Democrat, favors it.

The decision is also expected to raise the stakes in the 1990 gubernatorial and state legislative elections, with both national parties investing heavily in these races since the results will largely determine who gets to draw the new district lines for Congress and the legislatures themselves after the 1990 Census.

Overall, the Supreme Court's decision has significant implications for the right to abortion in the United States, with opponents of abortion likely to continue pushing for further restrictions at the state level."

Daughtry's critics have accused him of being an opportunist, using volatile situations to further his own goals. However, his supporters praise his commitment to social justice and his ability to document the cases he advocates for.

The article highlights several specific instances where Daughtry was involved in protests or advocacy efforts, including:

* A boycott of Carrington's clothing store after a black woman was falsely accused of shoplifting and slapped by the manager
* A rally of 20,000 hospital workers demonstrating for better contracts

Daughtry has also been involved in issues such as police brutality, leading numerous marches over the years. He has worked with various organizations and individuals to bring attention to these issues.

Despite being criticized by some for his methods, Daughtry is widely respected within the black community for his commitment to social justice. He has been a persistent critic of the media and of black and white citizens for their response to certain incidents, such as the rape of a white woman jogger in Central Park while ignoring similar attacks on black women.

8907051,266816,"The state of California and Dade County, Florida are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the Census Bureau's methods for counting minority populations in urban areas. The agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the Commerce Department includes:

1. Conducting a post-enumeration survey (PES) to determine who was counted correctly, who was undercounted, and who was not counted at all.
2. An eight-member panel will be appointed by the Commerce Secretary to advise and monitor the Census Bureau on carrying out the PES program.
3. The deadline for publishing any corrected counts is July 1991.
4. If the Commerce Department publishes counts before determining if any corrections are needed, the figures will carry a caveat stating that they are subject to readjustment.

The lawsuit was filed in November and contends that the Census Bureau was prepared to make statistical adjustments to compensate for undercounting in next year's survey but was overruled by the Commerce Department. The agreement marks a significant victory for the plaintiffs, who have long complained about the undercounting of minority populations in urban areas.

The post-enumeration survey is expected to be a more comprehensive and accurate method for counting minority populations than previous surveys. The survey will help to determine who was counted correctly, who was undercounted, and who was not counted at all.

	* The debate between studio-based art education and discipline-based arts education
	* Concerns about Western bias in the discipline-based approach
	* The lack of formal testing or evaluation methods in arts education
4. Look for quotes that summarize the main issue or highlight key points of contention:
	* ""Arts education is still largely undervalued and ignored, still largely not available in an overwhelming number of schools,"" said Leilani Lattin Duke.
	* ""It is a fundamental and difficult challenge to change that.""
5. Identify potential solutions or initiatives being proposed or discussed:
	* The Studio in a School program, which places artists in residence for up to two years in elementary schools around the city
	* The Getty Center's support for discipline-based arts education
	* The National Arts Education Research Center at New York University's workshop for high school arts teachers

By following these steps, I can identify key issues and players in the protest movement surrounding arts education, as well as potential solutions and initiatives being proposed or discussed."

8907065,269064,"Based on this news article, here's some extracted protest information related to balls and air fresheners as potential cancer-causing substances:

* Chemical: Paradichlorobenzene
* Potential health effect: Cancer or other chronic disease in humans
* Source of concern: National Toxicology Program report
* Controversy:
	+ Industry (Synthetic Organic Chemicals Association, Chlorobenzene Producers Association, and Chemical Manufacturers Association) argues that animal tests should not be used solely to determine whether a chemical can cause cancer in humans.
	+ Scientists and regulatory agencies rely on animal tests as the first indicator of potential carcinogenicity.
* New techniques developed:
	+ Studies on mechanisms by which chemicals affect the body, rather than relying solely on animal test results.
	+ Examination of specific chemical and physical reactions.
* Ethical concerns:
	+ Dr. Philip J. Landrigan argues that it is not ethical to allow humans to be exposed to potential carcinogens for 20-30 years until sufficient evidence is gathered to prove a substance causes cancer in humans.
	+ Public health officials say that allowing this could compromise the regulation of chemicals and curtail public awareness of dangerous ones.

The controversy surrounding paradichlorobenzene highlights the ongoing debate between industry representatives, scientists, and regulatory agencies regarding the use of animal tests in determining the potential carcinogenicity of chemicals."
8907072,269064,"Protest Information:

* The chemical industry has filed a lawsuit challenging the practice of using animal tests as evidence that a substance can cause cancer or disease in humans.
* The suit argues that additional information about the way paradichlorobenzene works on rats should have been considered by the National Toxicology Program before listing it as a human carcinogen.
* The industry is seeking to prevent the publication of a cancer report that lists paradichlorobenzene as a potential cancer-causing substance.
* Regulatory agencies, scientists, public health officials, and citizens' groups rely on animal tests to determine whether certain substances could cause cancer or other chronic disease in humans.
* Industry representatives argue that new techniques have been developed for looking at the formation of cancer in humans and that animal tests are not a reliable indicator of carcinogenicity.
* Public health officials and scientists argue that even though mechanisms may differ between animals and humans, if a chemical causes cancer in an animal there is a good chance it can do so in humans.
* The lawsuit has been held up in Federal District Court in Lake Charles, La. for almost two years.
* If the industry prevails, public health officials say that the regulation of chemicals could be compromised and public awareness of dangerous ones curtailed.

Protest Movement:

* The American Council on Science and Health, a consumer education and advocacy group, is supporting the industry's lawsuit.
* The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, opposes the industry's lawsuit and argues that animal tests are a necessary step in determining the carcinogenic potential of substances.
* Environmental health experts at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Health argue that reliance on tests of rats and other laboratory animals has broad scientific acceptance as a predictor of cancer in humans.

Key Terms:

* Paradichlorobenzene: A chemical substance that is being challenged as a potential cancer-causing substance by the industry.
* Animal tests: Laboratory tests that use animals to determine whether a substance can cause cancer or disease in humans.
* National Toxicology Program: A government program that evaluates the carcinogenic potential of substances based on animal tests and other evidence.
* Carcinogen: A substance that is capable of causing cancer."
8907073,269124,"A significant news article about a landmark case involving the ""right to die"" debate. Here are some key points extracted from the article:

**Case Background**: Nancy Beth Cruzan is a patient with a persistent vegetative state, diagnosed as irreversibly comatose. Her parents have been fighting in court to disconnect her life-sustaining feeding tube, which would allow her to live another 30 years.

**State Courts' Approaches**: State courts have struggled for over a decade with the ethical and legal implications of this technology, leading to varying approaches across different states. The Missouri Supreme Court has taken a more restrictive stance, prioritizing the state's interest in preserving life over an individual's right to privacy.

**Constitutional Connection**: The case raises questions about the constitutional right to privacy, which was previously established through abortion precedents (Roe v. Wade). This connection is evident from the way state courts have approached right-to-die cases, seeking to balance individual interests with state interests in preserving life.

**Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Anti-abortion groups see a link between this case and abortion rights, while advocates for patients' rights argue that these issues are distinct. The American Medical Association and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons have issued guidelines permitting withdrawal of feeding tubes in similar cases.

**Stakes**: A nationwide ruling on this issue could impact thousands of people with irreversible comatose conditions, as well as the broader debate around end-of-life care and patients' rights."

8907079,269752,"Here is the extracted protest information from the news article:

**Dispute:** The dispute over gambling on the St. Regis Reservation, which involves illegal slot machines in casinos along the main road.

**Protest Groups:**

1. **Sovereignty Security Force**: A heavily armed group that erected roadblocks along Route 37 to protect the Mohawk people against federal and state agencies.
2. **Traditional Council**: The ancient governing board of the Mohawks, which claims sovereignty over both the Canadian and American sides of the reservation.

**Protest Actions:**

1. Destruction of slot machines by opponents of gambling.
2. Roadblocks set up by the Sovereignty Security Force to prevent non-residents from entering the reservation.
3. Checkpoints established by state troopers on roads leading onto the reservation to restrict access.

**Concerns and Goals:**

1. **Fear of violence**: Many residents are afraid of the armed security force, which has started to seem normal in the standoff situation.
2. **Protection of traditions**: Some argue that allowing gambling would corrupt Indian culture and defeat the purpose of the Great Law of Peace.
3. **Self-governance**: The Mohawks want to form their own police force and govern themselves without interference from federal or state agencies.

**Legal Issues:**

1. **State law**: New York state law prohibits gambling except for bingo and some charitable games.
2. **Federal law**: A 1948 Federal law gives New York jurisdiction to enforce its criminal codes on reservations in the state, but Mohawks argue that this is not a written agreement.
3. **Grant application**: The Mohawks have applied for a Federal grant to form their own police force and govern themselves.

**Quotes:**

2. ""Gambling should be recognized as a viable and legal form of industry."" - David Jacobs
3. ""The Great Law says you always must look seven generations into the future."" - Jake Swamp"
8907088,270505,"The article discusses the new regulations regarding freshwater wetland areas in New Jersey, which were authorized by the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act passed in 1987. The main issue is the establishment of buffer zones around these areas, which can be up to 150 feet wide and require developers to conduct environmental tests to determine the resource-value classification of the area.

The regulations have generated concern among builders, who claim that obtaining waivers from the State Department of Environmental Protection will be difficult, if not impossible. They also argue that the size of the buffer zones is arbitrary and difficult to define, which can lead to costly redesigns for projects already in the pipeline.

Environmentalists, on the other hand, see the benefits of these regulations, including flood protection and the preservation of ecological balance. They argue that the transition areas between wetlands and upland habitats are crucial for animal migration and nesting, and that the buffer zones will help to prevent property damage during flooding events.

The article also quotes several experts in the field, including Donald Linke, a lawyer who represents large developers in the state. He argues that the regulations go ""well beyond traditional role"" of environmental regulation and that it is difficult for developers to plan effectively with ambiguous restrictions.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding the new regulations regarding freshwater wetland areas in New Jersey, with builders expressing concerns about the costs and difficulties associated with complying with the rules, while environmentalists emphasize the importance of protecting the environment."

Explanation:
1. The ruling by the judge ends a long legal fight and opens the records to the public, which could be seen as a form of ""parading chariots"" (category 17).
2. The article mentions that some records were destroyed or removed years ago, indicating possible attempts to cover up information, which could be seen as a form of ""holding signs"" (category 20).
3. Judge Barbour's ruling also mentions that some files have been lost or pilfered, which could be seen as a form of ""sloganeering/chanting"" (category 28), emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability.
4. The article quotes Governor Mabus saying that by opening the files, Mississippi can focus on the future, which could be seen as a form of ""drumming"" (category 44) to promote unity and progress."

* 1: The article mentions that Greenpeace darted about the edges of a ""safety zone"" established around the Exxon Valdez by the Coast Guard, which is a form of bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, etc. (Category 1).
* 20: Throughout the article, protesters are holding signs and displaying placards, which is a type of holding signs or picket line (Category 20).
* 43: The Coast Guard established a ""safety zone"" around the Exxon Valdez, which might be considered a form of torch-passing or passing of other item in relay (Category 43), although this is a bit of a stretch.
* 98: This code refers to other activities that are not specifically listed elsewhere. In this case, I'm grouping Greenpeace's actions, such as darting about the edges of the safety zone and displaying their vessel with a spokesman, under ""other activity"" (Category 98)."
8907092,270994,"Based on the article, it appears that many state politicians are expressing concerns about the impact of the recent Supreme Court decision on abortion rights. Some governors and legislators are worried that the controversy surrounding the issue will dominate political discussions and hinder progress on other important issues.

Some quotes from politicians include:

* Gov. Michael N. Castle (R-DE): ""It has the ability to dominate things so much that you can't do anything else.""
* Gov. William Donald Schaefer (D-MD): ""I've urged my Legislature to dispose of all abortion bills in the first 30 days of its next session.""
* Gov. Bill Clinton (D-AR): ""They're not emotionally satisfied because you won't get way over on one extreme.""
* Gov. James R. Thompson (R-IL): ""They condemn us for straddling when we try to be thoughtful.""

Some politicians are also expressing frustration with demands that they take a clear stance on the issue, with some saying that it's difficult to find middle ground.

The article suggests that the political impact of the issue will vary depending on how often it has arisen at the state level. In states where abortion has been heavily debated, politicians may face pressure from voters and special interest groups.

Some specific examples of political fallout include:

* In Virginia, Republican candidates for Governor have softened their anti-abortion stands to appeal to a broader range of voters.
* In Massachusetts, two leading Democratic candidates for Governor engaged in a fierce argument over abortion rights.
* In New Jersey, some politicians are expressing concern that single-issue voting on abortion will become more prevalent.

Overall, the article suggests that the controversy surrounding abortion is likely to have significant political implications at the state level."

Hawkins, a 16-year-old African American who was attacked and killed by a group of white youths on August 23. The march was organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton and involved hundreds of people, mostly black, who walked through the Italian-American neighborhood while residents lined the streets, some shouting racist slurs.

The police were present to maintain order, but there was no major violence reported. Some protesters shouted ""Animals! Animals!"" which angered residents, who claimed that they were being unfairly labeled as racists.

The march was the fourth since Hawkins' death and was preceded by two violent clashes between demonstrators and police in downtown Brooklyn. The article also mentions the release on bail of some suspects in the case, including Joseph Fama, 18, who is accused of actually shooting Hawkins.

	+ Increased police presence, with a foot-patrol officer assigned at night and radio-car surveillance
	+ Residents feel more empowered and part of a community

Note that this protest is a community-based initiative by residents who are taking matters into their own hands to address a problem that the police and authorities have been unable or unwilling to solve."

8909025,281874,"Based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities as follows:

< 28 ; 20 ; 41 ; 98>

Explanation:
1. The article does not explicitly mention bannering or hanging banners on buildings (category 1), bell ringing (category 2), bicycling (category 3), candle-lighting (category 4), canvassing (category 5), cross carrying (category 6), dances (category 7), debates (category 8), discussions (category 9), dramaturgical presentations (category 10), fasting or hunger strikes (category 11), film showings (category 12), fireworks displays (category 13), leafleting (category 15), meditation (category 16), parading chariots (category 17), petitioning (category 18), photo exhibiting (category 19), reading or recitation (category 23), selling goods (category 25), silence (category 26), speechmaking (category 27), sloganeering/chanting (category 28), vigiling (category 29), wreathing (category 32), display of symbolic displays (category 33), press conferences (category 34), dedications or ceremonial activities (category ?), legal delays (category ?) or highway building (category ?).

2. The article does mention that only 34 sites have been declared clean out of the 1,175 toxic waste sites on the National Priority List for immediate attention, which can be seen as a form of protest against the slow pace of cleanup efforts (category 28). This activity is also mentioned in the context of Walter Kovalick Jr., deputy director of the agency's Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, who said ""We think improvements are possible, but substantial progress has been made.""

3. The article also mentions that Congress has only spent about half of what was appropriated by Congress for cleanup projects, which can be seen as a protest against the lack of funding for environmental efforts (category 41). This activity is also mentioned in the context of Jan Paul Acton, author of the study, who said ""What we've got is a gap between the rhetoric and the reality.""

4. The article does not explicitly mention any other protest activities beyond these three.

Therefore, I would categorize the protest activities as follows: < 28 ; 20 ; 41 ; 98>."
8909026,281947,"Based on the provided news article, here are some key points about the protest:

1. **Marches were peaceful**: Despite concerns about violence or heckling, both marches through Bensonhurst were carried out peacefully.
2. **Leaders urged calm**: The leaders of the march, including Alton H. Maddox Jr., and Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, urged participants to refrain from responding to provocations and to remain disciplined throughout the march.
3. **Marchers chanted slogans**: The larger group of marchers, numbering 250-300 people, chanted slogans such as ""Yusuf! Yusuf! Yusuf!"" while passing the site where Yusuf K. Hawkins was killed.
4. **No open heckling from onlookers**: Despite some quiet expressions of resentment among neighborhood residents, there was no open heckling or violence directed at the marchers.
5. **Plans for more marches**: The Rev. Al Sharpton announced plans for more marches in Bensonhurst, Chicago, and Virginia Beach, VA, to continue drawing attention to racial tensions and violence.
6. **Reports of death threats**: Some black residents reported receiving death threats from whites in the area, prompting concern about potential violence on the first day of classes.
7. **Clergy involvement**: The Rev. Herbert B. Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn, planned to visit public schools in the area with other black clergymen to prevent outbreaks of racial violence.

Overall, the marches were characterized by a focus on peaceful protest and restraint, despite underlying tensions and concerns about violence."
8909027,281947,"Here are the protests and demonstrations mentioned in the article:

1. Marches: Two groups of protesters, one with about 35 people and another with around 250-300 demonstrators, marched through the Bensonhurst neighborhood in Brooklyn to protest racism and violence.
2. ""Justice for Yusuf Hawkins"" march: The larger group of protesters was led by Alton H. Maddox Jr., a civil rights lawyer and black community leader, and marched past the site where Yusuf K. Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth, was shot and killed on August 23.
3. Planned marches: Rev. Al Sharpton announced plans for more marches in Bensonhurst, Chicago, and Virginia Beach, VA, to protest racial violence and injustice.

The protests were characterized by:

1. Carrying placards and chanting slogans against racism
2. No open heckling from onlookers, but some quiet expressions of resentment
3. Heavy police presence, with over 800 officers escorting the marchers through the neighborhood
4. Appeals for calm and restraint from local leaders and community members, including Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro and a group of white youths who went door-to-door urging residents to refrain from heckling or violence.

The protests were sparked by the killing of Yusuf K. Hawkins on August 23, which was widely condemned as an act of racial violence. The marches and demonstrations were intended to bring attention to the issue and demand justice for Hawkins' family."

2; 20; 25; 43

Here's how I arrived at these answers:

* 2: Bell ringing - The article mentions that there is no thought to be any link between the vandalism and the drive for a King statue, but the convergence of events underscores the contrasts on a modern Southern campus. This implies that bell ringing might have been used as a protest activity in the past or could be used in the future.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The article mentions that black students may feel uncomfortable on the Texas campus and that a group of students has proposed a statue of Dr. King. This implies that holding signs and engaging in informational picketing might be used as a protest activity to raise awareness about the issue.
* 25: Selling buttons, bumper-stickers, books, frisbees bearing demo info - The article mentions that the Martin Luther King Jr. Statue Foundation has raised $2,000 and found a sculptor to create the statue. This implies that selling materials with demonstration information might be used as a way to raise funds and awareness for the cause.
* 43: Torch-passing or passing of other item in relay - The article mentions that investigators have few leads on the vandalism and are ""at a dead end."" This implies that torch-passing or passing of other items in relay might be used as a protest activity to draw attention to the issue."

< 20; 26; 28; 41>

Here's my explanation for each code:

1. <20>: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (Code 20) - The protesters formed a flotilla of small boats in the Thames River with signs and banners mocking the ceremony.
2. <26>: Silence references to deliberate, designated periods of silence, silent worship, silent vigil (Code 26) - Although not explicitly mentioned, the protesters' use of inflatable rafts and fake missiles in response to the Navy's gun firing can be seen as a form of silent protest or mocking the official ceremony.
3. <28>: Sloganeering/chanting chanting same small sets of words (Code 28) - The article doesn't mention specific slogans, but it implies that the protesters were chanting or making noise with their fake missiles and slingshots.
4. <41>: Polling report of polling attitudes regarding social movement claim (Code 41) - This code refers to reports on public opinion about a social movement or issue. Although not directly related to the protest activity, it's possible that some form of public opinion was gathered among the protesters or supporters outside the ceremony."

8909032,282861,"The article discusses the ongoing controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and its funding in Congress. Representative Rohrabacher, a staunch conservative from California, plans to introduce a motion to add an amendment to a spending bill that would effectively eliminate funding for the NEA. Rohrabacher has been preparing for this move by studying with Representative William E. Dannemeyer, a skilled practitioner of legislative guerrilla warfare.

To build support for his motion, Rohrabacher has lined up leaders from 22 national organizations representing conservative interests. These leaders have signed a letter to all House members stating their opposition to the NEA's sponsorship of obscene and indecent art. Rohrabacher plans to present this issue as a referendum on mom-and-apple-pie values versus perversity.

The article also highlights the risks that House members who oppose Rohrabacher's motion will face. Last July, 88 House Democrats voted against a $45,000 cut in the NEA's budget, and the National Republican Congressional Committee targeted those members for criticism in their home districts. The committee sent press releases with headlines like ""Votes in Favor of Federally Subsidized Obscenity.""

The article also quotes Representative Yates, a 14-year veteran of fighting off attempts to weaken the NEA, who believes that Rohrabacher's attempt will fail because it has been voted down before.

Finally, the article notes that Senator Helms, who originally introduced the amendment in the Senate, is not giving up. He plans to dramatize his position by sending prints of Mapplethorpe photographs to Senate conferees and requesting a roll-call vote if his amendment is dropped."

8909049,284329,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding New York State's search for a site to dispose of low-level nuclear waste. The state is under a federal mandate to find a home for this waste by 1993, and two finalists, Allegany County and Cortland County, have been selected.

Protests have erupted in both counties, with residents expressing outrage and fear over the potential risks posed by the dump. Many people are refusing to accept that the state has chosen their county as the site for the nuclear waste disposal facility. The article highlights the strong opposition from local residents, including some who have never protested anything before but are now determined to stop the dump.

Some residents see the state's decision as a form of discrimination against rural and low-income areas. They argue that wealthier and more populated areas in New York would be more suitable sites for the nuclear waste disposal facility.

The article also mentions efforts by other states to find a site for their own nuclear waste, with some having already made decisions on where to locate their facilities.

Overall, the controversy surrounding New York State's search for a site to dispose of low-level nuclear waste highlights the complex and contentious issues involved in siting such facilities."

1. The article mentions that the demonstrators staged a ""die-in"" where they lay prone on the street, which falls under the category of dramaturgical presentation (skit, street theater, guerilla theater, theatrical event, use of puppets, mimes, clowns) which is code 10.
2. The article mentions that the protesters held signs and waved them while chanting slogans, which falls under the category of holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (code 20).
3. The article describes the protesters lying down on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is a form of procession or marching (code 22).
4. The article mentions that the group banged drums and blew whistles, which falls under the category of making loud noise (code 58). However, since there are other protest activities mentioned in the article, I have chosen to code this activity as ""making loud noise"" instead of a more specific code like ""drumming"" (code 51).

Note: The article does not mention any other specific protest activities beyond these four."

8910024,289954,"**California Initiative Aims to Enact Sweeping Environmental Protections**

A proposed ballot measure in California seeks to enforce strong environmental protections, potentially drawing opposition from chemical and agricultural industries. The initiative aims to address three major concerns: food supply, global warming, and coastal water protection.

Key provisions include:

1. Phasing out pesticides and herbicides linked to cancer or reproductive harm by 1996.
2. Reducing allowable levels of pesticide residues on foods to safe levels for children.
3. Lengthening quarantine periods for farm workers exposed to dangerous pesticides.
4. Developing a plan to reduce emissions contributing to global warming, targeting a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide by 2010.
5. Phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by 1997, except for medical uses.
6. Establishing a $200 million state fund to purchase ancient redwood trees and imposing a one-year moratorium on logging.
7. Restricting new offshore oil drilling within the three-mile state limit, with a national emergency exception.

The initiative has received support from environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, and Natural Resources Defense Council. While some environmentalists express concerns about the measure's scope and potential legal challenges, many see it as a crucial step in addressing California's environmental issues.

The proposal is expected to be challenged on the grounds that it addresses multiple topics, violating California's constitutional provision for single-topic ballot measures. Nevertheless, its proponents believe it has strong popular support and will become law if approved by voters in 1990."

8911001,296907,"The protest against President Schmidt's handling of the arrests at the Lesbian and Gay Study Center at Yale University is sparked by concerns about anti-gay violence and attitudes. The protesters are demanding that charges be dropped against nine men who were arrested while participating in a conference, and that the officers involved in the arrests be dismissed. They are also calling for President Schmidt to make a public statement condemning anti-gay violence and attitudes.

The incident began when a participant in the conference, William Dobbs, was arrested by Yale police officers after he put up a sexually explicit poster in the law school. The poster is one of a series made by a group of San Francisco artists that show men posing in the nude and contain the phrase ""Sex Is"" or ""Just Sex."" A shoving match erupted between conference participants and officers, leading to eight other arrests by the New Haven police.

The protesters are also criticizing President Schmidt's handling of previous incidents involving anti-gay violence and attitudes. In 1982, Newsweek magazine reported that Yale had an unusually visible gay community. In 1986, a student was sentenced to two years' academic probation for satirizing a poster promoting Gay and Lesbian Awareness Day. And in 1987, the university started one of the nation's first lesbian and gay studies centers.

The protesters are demanding that President Schmidt take a stronger stance against anti-gay violence and attitudes. They want him to condemn anti-gay violence and attitudes in a public statement, and to drop charges against the nine men who were arrested. They also want the officers involved in the arrests to be dismissed.

Overall, the protest is a response to what the protesters see as President Schmidt's lack of sensitivity to homosexuals and his failure to take a strong stance against anti-gay violence and attitudes."

	+ Dean of Students Torrey Sun stated that the college has a standard of conduct that imposes restraints on activities that impede normal daily routine, but did not criticize those involved with the striptease.

Key Quotes:

* ""If they can take a stance and say they oppose racism, then they should take a stance and say they oppose sexism."" - Senior Chris Welniak
* ""To be honest with you, I'm not sure whether the striptease was sexist... Personally, it's not something I would have arranged."" - Dean of Students Torrey Sun
* ""I graduated from an all-men's college and went straight into the Marines afterward. Both of these aren't institutions known publicly to be sensitive.

* Justice Scalia argued that there is a parental interest involved, alongside the filial interest, and that parents have a ""right to know"" about their child's abortion.
* Justice O'Connor pointed out that there might be circumstances where it would not be in the best interests of the child to inform both parents of her problem and intention.
* The debate between the two Justices was conducted through questions posed to Minnesota's Chief Deputy Attorney General, John R. Tunheim.

8912018,306909,"According to the article, there is no single entity that decides what is appropriate when it comes to art. The New School administration allowed the disputed drawing to be displayed, citing artistic freedom as the standard. Some students and faculty members supported this decision, arguing that censoring art would set a precedent for censorship in general.

However, others criticized the administration's decision, stating that other freedoms, such as the right to be free from intolerance and racial bias, should be given equal weight. Associate Dean John Jeffries, who is black, argued that ""freedom of expression is no more sacred than freedom from intolerance or bigotry.""

The incident has also raised questions about institutionalizing racism by allowing the drawing to remain on display. Some critics argue that the New School's decision to allow the picture to be displayed has perpetuated racial bias.

It seems that the issue of what is appropriate in art is a complex one, and there are different opinions on how to balance artistic freedom with the need to protect individuals from harm or offense."

* The Allen family has agreed to sell their 730-acre farm to the state for use as a dump site.
* This decision has sparked widespread opposition from local residents, who are vehemently against the idea of storing nuclear waste in their community.
* Protesters have marched on the Allen farm, and some have threatened the family's safety. Mr. Allen's life has been threatened, and his wife, Sondra, has received letters denouncing their decision to sell the land.
* The situation is expected to escalate further with the upcoming inspections of the two Taylor sites by members of the siting commission staff.
* Opponents of the dump have vowed to prevent entry to the sites, and some have threatened to physically block access.
* The Allen family's decision to sell has not been easy, as they love their farm but are facing financial pressures. They hope to receive $800,000 to $1 million for the land.

The article highlights the intense emotions and tensions surrounding this issue, with some residents viewing the Allens' decision as a ""betrayal"" of their community. The situation is expected to remain volatile in the coming weeks."

1. Bannering or hanging banners on buildings: There is no explicit mention of bannering in the article. However, it can be inferred that the protesters may have been holding signs or placards while blocking clinic entrances (activity 20).
20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing: As mentioned earlier, it's likely that protesters held signs or placards while blocking clinic entrances.
27. Speechmaking: The article mentions a ""demonstration"" where protesters got into shoving matches with supporters of abortion rights. This suggests some form of speechmaking or chanting (activity 28), but I've coded this as 27 since it's more general and might not necessarily involve loud chanting.
44. Singing collectively: Although the article doesn't explicitly state that the protesters sang, the use of phrases like ""demonstration"" and ""protest"" implies a collective action that might have included singing or chanting.

**Incidents:**

1. March 1, 1955: Eugene D. Haynes, a security guard, received a radiation dose of at least 39 rems while accompanying radiation specialists to the blast site.
2. November 1955 and January 1956: At least four workers received excessive radiation doses during experiments simulating warhead destructions.
3. February 1, 1956: Oral B. Epley died of a brain hemmorhage at age 57.
4. November 24, 1961: 108 miners were exposed to excessive radiation levels while working in tunnels deep beneath the Nevada Test Site.
5. June 6, 1963: 13 miners were contaminated by radioactive iodine produced by an atomic test.

**Missteps:**

1. Prioritizing production over safety led to worker exposure to excessive radiation.
2. Lack of proper training and supervision contributed to incidents.
3. Poor record-keeping in the 1950s and 1960s makes it difficult to determine the health effects on workers.

**Trail:** The series of blunders, mishaps, and accidents resulted in a somber trail of worker injuries and fatalities.

**Resulting Lawsuits:**

1. Eugene D. Haynes' widow is a plaintiff.
2. The families of Oral B. Epley and Joe Carter are plaintiffs.

**Changes in Present Procedures:**

1. Radiation safety and training programs have been sharply improved since the 1960s.
2. The Energy Department has started studying the health effects on workers at atomic weapons plants, but no comprehensive survey has been conducted for Nevada Test Site employees.

**Big Improvement:** Radiation safety has significantly improved, with nobody receiving excessive radiation exposure at the test site now."

9001021,314304,"This news article is reporting on the aftermath of President George H.W. Bush's military intervention in Panama, specifically focusing on how the operation has affected his political standing.

Key points:

1. The intervention has strengthened Mr. Bush's political position at home, replacing a perception of timidity or indecisiveness with one of discipline, firmness, and willingness to use force.
2. Television images of American troops being greeted warmly by Panamanians have created a positive impression on the American public.
3. Even if embarrassing disclosures or failures arise from the trial of General Manuel Noriega, Mr. Bush's political benefits are unlikely to be erased.
4. Some Democrats, such as Senator George J. Mitchell and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, have praised Mr. Bush for his handling of the situation.
5. However, not all Democrats are pleased with the operation. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a potential 1992 presidential contender, has spoken out against the military action.
6. The capture of General Noriega has removed the invasion as a political issue for Democrats to use against Mr. Bush.

4. <50> - Protest or social unrest: While there isn't any direct mention of a protest, the article implies that there is widespread discontent and frustration among the public about the way the case was handled, particularly with regards to the media coverage."

9001039,315385,"This article discusses several Supreme Court cases from the late 1970s and early 1980s related to affirmative action and public policy. At issue are precedents dating from the late 1970s, when the Court held that increasing racial diversity is an important goal of public policy and that the Federal Government has greater discretion under the Constitution than do state or local governments to devise affirmative action programs.

The article highlights two specific cases:

1. **Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. F.C.C.**: The case concerns a policy adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1978 to increase minority ownership of broadcast outlets. The FCC's ""plus-factor"" policy awards a bonus to minority-owned broadcasting companies when they bid on licenses for new stations or frequencies. The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal from Metro Broadcasting, which claims that the policy violates the First Amendment by favoring one group over others.
2. **United Steelworkers v. Rawson**: This case deals with whether workers injured on the job can sue their labor unions for negligence in failing to carry out safety provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.

Additionally, the article mentions other opinions and decisions made by the Supreme Court, including:

1. **National Guard**: The Court agreed to decide whether the Federal Government has the constitutional authority to force Governors to permit the mobilization of state National Guard units to active duty overseas.
2. **Union's Duty**: The Court agreed to decide whether workers injured on the job can sue their labor unions for negligence in failing to carry out safety provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.
3. **Libel Judgment**: Without comment, the Court refused to hear an appeal by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation whose $25 million libel suit against Peter Mattheissen was dismissed by a Federal appeals court.

Overall, this article provides insight into the Supreme Court's decisions and opinions related to affirmative action, public policy, labor unions, and national security."
9001042,315609,"This article appears to be discussing a Supreme Court decision involving the University of Pennsylvania and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The case revolves around the confidentiality of tenure evaluations and whether they can be accessed by the EEOC in cases where discrimination is suspected.

The Court's decision, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, rejected the university's arguments that disclosure of peer review materials would chill academic freedom and make it difficult to evaluate tenure candidates. Instead, the Court held that the EEOC only needs to show that the requested material is ""relevant"" to its inquiry, which is a lower standard than demonstrating a special need for the files.

The decision was seen as a victory for civil rights groups who argued that secrecy in the tenure process has been used as a shield for discrimination against women and minority candidates. The Court's analysis suggested that individual faculty members may not have the same level of protection for confidentiality, which could lead to greater transparency in tenure evaluations.

In addition to the University of Pennsylvania case, the article also mentions another Supreme Court decision involving a Dallas ordinance requiring a license to operate a ""sexually oriented business."" In this case, the Court held that the licensing system operated as an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech."

9001050,316154,"The article reports on several discrimination cases settled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the late 1980s. The main case discussed is that of Leadell Lee, a 48-year-old agent who accused the FBI of denying him promotions that went to less qualified white agents. As a result of the settlement, Mr. Lee received at least $60,000 and was allowed to remain with the agency.

The article also mentions two other cases that were settled: one brought by Gertie Mae Armstrong, a clerical worker in the FBI's Omaha office, and another involving about 30 workers in the FBI's identification division in Washington. The terms of these settlements are not disclosed due to confidentiality agreements.

Civil rights lawyers hail the settlements as an effort by bureau officials to ease the racial climate within the agency. However, some critics argue that more needs to be done to address lingering racial problems within the FBI. Specifically, there is a major lawsuit pending against the FBI brought by agent Donald Rochon, who alleges brutal harassment by white colleagues in the Chicago office.

The article also notes that the FBI has faced allegations of sex discrimination in the past, including a class action proceeding filed in 1977 that resulted in cash settlements for several women employed by the FBI."

The article highlights several key points:

1. **Fading fervor**: Opponents' passion and protests have diminished since the pipeline route was rerouted away from more affluent towns.
2. **Arthur Miller remark**: A comment made by Gary B. Davis, Iroquois spokesman, about playwright Arthur Miller's disinterest in the project sparked controversy and still rankles some opponents.
3. **Wooing local politicians and residents**: Iroquois has been actively engaging with local officials and residents to address concerns and provide information, which has helped to ease tensions.
4. **Environmental and economic concerns**: Opponents continue to express worries about potential environmental impacts (e.g., leaks or explosions) and the pipeline's effect on local economies.
5. **Economic need for the pipeline**: Iroquois officials argue that natural gas is needed due to its cleaner-burning properties and availability, while opponents question whether the project has been thoroughly vetted.

It will be interesting to see how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Army Corps of Engineers ultimately decide on the pipeline's approval."

9001065,318941,"This article reports on a public hearing in Connecticut regarding a plan by state wildlife officials to reduce the mute swan population through egg-shaking, also known as ""addling."" The plan aims to cut the number of swans from around 1,900 to approximately 440 over the next 15 years.

The proposal has sparked strong reactions from both supporters and opponents. Animal rights advocates argue that the plan is a form of mass slaughter, while fishermen and homeowners who have been affected by the increasing swan population see it as a necessary measure to control the birds' aggressive behavior and protect native waterfowl and aquatic organisms.

Some of the key points mentioned in the article include:

1. The mute swans are not indigenous to the area but were introduced from Europe in the late 19th century for estate purposes.
2. The swan population has increased significantly over the years, with the Department of Environmental Protection estimating around 500 swans in 1973 and 1,900 in 1989.
3. Addling is already used to control swan populations in other states, including Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland.
4. Opponents question the state's methodology for counting swan numbers, with ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson claiming that there are fewer swans than reported.
5. The plan has been met with strong opposition from animal rights advocates, who argue it is a form of mass slaughter.
6. Fishermen and homeowners affected by the increasing swan population support the plan as a necessary measure to control the birds' aggressive behavior.

Overall, this article highlights the controversy surrounding the proposed addling program in Connecticut, with different stakeholders having varying levels of concern and support for the initiative."

1. Vigiling: The article mentions that officials spent $500,000 to protect 75 Ku Klux Klan members who paraded through downtown Atlanta, and again for a similar event today. This indicates that vigil is an ongoing protest activity.

20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing: The article describes counter-demonstrators throwing stones and bottles and surging through police lines during a previous march by white supremacists, indicating that holding signs or engaging in other forms of placarding is a part of the protest.

27. Speechmaking: The article quotes Richard Barrett, head of the Nationalist Movement, as saying that it's not possible to put a price tag on free speech. This implies that there was some form of speechmaking or testifying at one point during the protests.

30. Procession or marching: The article describes marches by civil rights groups and those that oppose them, which suggests that procession or marching is an ongoing protest activity.

The article highlights how Mr. Williams's views on monogamy and celibacy were perceived as inflammatory and led to a furor at a public forum in Michigan.

Key points from the article:

9002024,327755,"The release of Nelson Mandela from prison has invigorated black Americans who have been searching for ways to channel their elation. Many are questioning the intentions of the South African Government and doubting that a peaceful solution to the country's racial problems can be found. However, the news has inspired blacks who felt distant from Africa to begin embracing it.

Renaissance in Heritage
The events of the past week have sparked a renaissance in heritage, said Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The release of Mr. Mandela has let in a new pride in African roots and has ignited a new spirit of movement.

Many blacks are searching for ways to direct their elation, with some calling anti-apartheid groups and black-oriented bookstores to learn more about the issues and how they can help. Others are frustrated that there are no concrete steps they can take.

Marching
In several cities, people are turning to a civil rights staple to honor Mr. Mandela - marching. In bitter cold weather, more than 2,000 people marched down Woodward Avenue in Detroit on Wednesday, dancing and cheering as if their team had won the Super Bowl.

Invitations to Visit
Cities including Chicago, Detroit, and Oakland are extending invitations to Mr. Mandela to visit. Delores Skipper, an administrative assistant for an insurance company in Chicago, says she knows what she will do if Mr. Mandela comes there - she'll take off work and her son will stay home from school.

Spiritual Successor
American blacks who have seen leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X die violent deaths are latching onto Mr. Mandela as a kind of spiritual successor. It helps with my own small, dinky battles, said Walter Allen, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Heroism
The hunger for a modern-day hero seems especially acute in Chicago, where blacks have felt politically despondent since they lost their hero, the late Mayor Harold Washington. Everyone has been laying dormant waiting for something to happen, said Ty Wansley, the host of a black-oriented radio talk show in Chicago.

Letters and Classroom Discussions
Mr. Mandela has turned into the main topic of book reports, poetry, and classroom discussions among many black schoolchildren. At the 102d Street Elementary School in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Yvonne Shepard's fifth-grade class is working on a letter to Mr. Mandela, saying we are glad he was released and are behind him.

Television Sets
Many black Americans spent all day Sunday in front of their television sets watching coverage of Mr. Mandela. Arnold Johnson Jr., a Chicago beautician, his wife, Willetta, and their 15-month-old son, Jeremy, had two television sets and a radio tuned to coverage of Mr. Mandela.

Black Churches
Black churches across the country have been praising the anti-apartheid leader and praying for him since that day. The Wheeler Memorial Baptist Church in Chicago held a special service on Sunday to celebrate Mr. Mandela's release.

Complacency
Leaders of anti-apartheid groups in this country fear that blacks here will become complacent after the initial euphoria subsides. Aside from the release of Mr. Mandela and the partial unbanning of some organizations, nothing in South Africa has changed, said Randall Robinson, the executive director of TransAfrica.

Fear for Mr. Mandela
For some, the euphoria is already giving way to fear for Mr. Mandela's life and cynicism about his release merely being a ploy. During a debate among a group of men on a park bench in downtown Washington, one of them, Buck Callen, had a particularly grim view - I think the president let Mandela get out of prison so someone could kill him and get it over with.

Object Lesson
Civil rights groups are hoping that blacks here will learn something from Mr. Mandela. It's an object lesson to blacks that you don't have to throw bricks, shoot dope or carry guns to achieve stature, said Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

The talk of recent days has especially hit home to people like Helen Dayley, a 65-year-old retired domestic worker in Detroit. She grew up in rural Alabama, the daughter of a sharecropper who lived in a hut not unlike the ones in the poor black townships of South Africa."

1. Large corporations like General Motors (G.M.) and Consolidated Edison have successfully challenged their tax assessments, reducing their tax burdens.
2. G.M. has a 1985 settlement with the state that reduces its taxes by $1.9 million per year until 1995. When it returns to the tax rolls, it will pay around $6-10 million annually.
3. The school district is facing a budget crisis due to these reduced tax revenues, combined with a loss of $800,000 in state aid and other revenue sources.
4. To address this crisis, the superintendent has proposed asking G.M. for an advance on future taxes, which would be credited against its future tax payments.
5. Students, parents, and community members are advocating for help from Governor Mario M. Cuomo to resolve the budget crisis.

9003022,333629,"You're asking me to analyze the article about the Breathalyzer and its role in measuring alcohol content in breath vapor. The article highlights some concerns and controversies surrounding the use of this device as evidence in drunken driving cases.

Some key points from the article include:

1. The Breathalyzer was originally intended as a corroborative tool, not the sole basis for conviction.
2. Critics argue that the machine can be manipulated by police officers to produce inaccurate readings.
3. Dr. Robert F. Borkenstein, the inventor of the Breathalyzer, suggests that the device should only be used in conjunction with other evidence, such as observations of the suspect's behavior.
4. The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that errors inherent in calculating Breathalyzer results are acceptable and can continue to be used as evidence.
5. Sobriety checkpoints, also known as D.W.I. roadblocks, have been challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on constitutional grounds.

In terms of penalties for drunken driving, the article lists the following:

1st Offense:
- Up to 30 days imprisonment
- 6 months to 1 year license revocation
- 12 hours in intoxicated driver's resource center
- $250 to $400 fine
- $100 enforcement surcharge
- Insurance surcharge of $1,000/year for 3 years
- Up to 35% increase in insurance premium

2nd Offense:
- Up to 90 days imprisonment
- Mandatory 30 days community service
- Mandatory 2 days in jail or 48 hours in intoxicated drivers resource center
- $500 to $1,000 fine
- $100 enforcement surcharge
- Insurance surcharge of $1,000/year for 3 years
- Mandatory minimum $2,000 insurance deductible

3rd Offense:
- Mandatory 6 months imprisonment (can be commuted to 90 days community service)
- Mandatory 28-day inpatient alcohol treatment program
- Mandatory 10-year driver's license revocation
- Mandatory $1,000 fine
- $100 enforcement surcharge
- Insurance surcharge of $1,000/year for 3 years
- Mandatory minimum $2,000 insurance deductible

2. **Port Authority response**: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey defends the plan, saying they've made adjustments to offer relief to communities affected by noise.
3. **F.A.A. explanations**: The Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) claims that an environmental impact study wasn't necessary due to high-altitude operations. They're also working on antinoise measures, such as quieter aircraft or new models.

9003032,336451,"This article discusses the challenges faced by Asian-American students in New York City's schools, particularly those from China. The myth of the model minority, where Asian students are expected to excel academically without effort, puts pressure on these students to perform well and can lead to feelings of guilt or shame when they don't meet expectations.

The article highlights several issues faced by Asian-American students, including:

1. Inflated expectations: Teachers and parents often have high expectations for Asian students, which can be stressful and lead to anxiety.
2. Cultural dislocations: Asian students may struggle with cultural differences between their home culture and American culture, leading to feelings of isolation or disconnection.
3. Resentment from non-Asian classmates: Some students may resent the perceived success of Asian students, leading to bullying or harassment.
4. Pressure to conform: Asian parents may pressure their children to conform to traditional values and expectations, which can be difficult for students who want to assimilate into American culture.

The article also notes that many Asian-American students are silent victims of these pressures, struggling with mental health issues such as headaches or stomach troubles rather than openly expressing their concerns.

Recommendations from a Board of Education report include:

1. Increasing the number of Asian counselors and teachers in New York City schools.
2. Providing more support for Asian students who may be struggling academically or emotionally.
3. Educating teachers and parents about the challenges faced by Asian-American students and promoting greater understanding and acceptance.

9003034,336964,"This article discusses the efforts of anti-abortion groups in Idaho to pass a bill that would restrict access to abortion services. The legislation, which has already passed the House and is expected to be voted on in the Senate, would allow doctors to perform an abortion only in certain circumstances, such as rape or incest, or if the woman's physical health is at risk.

The article quotes Brian Johnston, the Western regional director of the anti-abortion group, who says that the goal is to give Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a reason to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973. The legislation is designed to address Justice O'Connor's concerns about making women criminally liable for having an abortion.

The bill has been criticized by opponents of the measure, who say it would force women to seek illegal or unsafe abortions if they are unable to meet the strict criteria outlined in the bill. They also argue that the legislation would create an ""impossible situation"" for doctors and medical professionals, as they would be forced to make difficult judgments about whether a woman's pregnancy was caused by rape or incest.

The article also notes that the abortion debate is not unique to Idaho, as several other states have taken action to restrict access to abortion services in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union has vowed to challenge any legislation that it believes is unconstitutional, and the issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court."

The article highlights several key points:

1. **Environmental theme in fashion**: The trend of incorporating environmental themes into fashion shows, such as using ivy or grass on runways, has become increasingly popular.
2. **Eco-friendly marketing**: Some fashion brands are now promoting their eco-friendly efforts through advertising and licensing arrangements, which can increase consumer self-image.
3. **Preservation efforts**: Companies like Bonjour and Hermes have started programs to educate consumers about environmental issues and raise funds for preservation groups.
4. **Skepticism and criticism**: Not everyone is convinced that these efforts will lead to meaningful changes in individual behavior or the environment. Some argue that the focus on eco-friendly marketing is merely a commercial cliche, disconnected from real concerns.
5. **Industry's underlying ethos of change**: The fashion industry thrives on change, but this can also contribute to fast consumerism and waste.

The article also quotes several industry experts, designers, and executives, offering different perspectives on the matter. Some, like Isaac Mizrahi, emphasize that their designs are driven by beauty and aesthetics rather than environmental concerns. Others, like Norma Kamali, suggest that there may be a need for a fundamental shift in how fashion is designed and presented.

Overall, this article provides an interesting glimpse into the intersection of fashion, sustainability, and consumer culture. It's intriguing to see how the industry is evolving and what steps are being taken to reduce its environmental impact."

9003045,338283,"The article discusses the debate surrounding the practice of ""outing"" prominent figures who are secretly gay or lesbian, with some advocating for the tactic as a means to provide positive role models and challenge discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, while others argue that it is a violation of privacy and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

Some key points from the article include:

1. The Human Rights Campaign Fund and other gay rights organizations believe that privacy is fundamental to the gay and lesbian movement.
2. Critics of the practice argue that it only further perpetuates the notion that being gay is shameful, and that it can be used as a form of blackmail or coercion against individuals who are not publicly out.
3. The article quotes Robert Bray, a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, saying that ""what do we do about homophobic homosexuals in positions of power? It's been a problem since Nazi Germany.""
4. Some argue that the tactic should be limited to politicians or those who have spoken out against gay people, while others believe it should be applied more broadly to prominent figures who hide their sexuality.
5. The article notes that there is no agreement on what actions by politicians justify exposing them, with some advocating for a ""middle ground"" approach based on personal suasion.

Overall, the debate surrounding outing highlights the complex and sensitive nature of privacy, identity, and power in the LGBTQ+ community."

9003048,338848,"The article reports on the controversy surrounding Robert Mapplethorpe's photography exhibition at the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati. The exhibition features explicit and provocative images that have sparked outrage among local residents, who are threatening to withdraw their business from board members' employers.

Some protesters have even threatened to cancel their accounts at a local bank whose chairman resigned amid boycott threats against his employer. The Cincinnati Police Chief has vowed to send officers to examine the exhibition and seize any photographs considered obscene.

The museum itself has gone to court seeking a ruling that the photographs are not obscene by Cincinnati community standards. The case has sparked strong reactions from both sides, with some calling for the most explicit images to be removed, while others argue that censorship would undermine the artistic value of the work.

The controversy has also highlighted the city's conservative values and its strict laws regarding pornography. Local groups such as Citizens for Community Values have been vocal in their opposition to the exhibition, claiming that it violates community standards.

On the other hand, leaders in the arts have stood firmly on the side of the arts center's decision to display the exhibition. They argue that artistic freedom is essential and that attempts to censor the work would be a violation of those freedoms.

The article concludes by noting that the controversy has had an impact on the museum, with some members threatening to cancel their memberships and others showing support for the exhibition. The case continues to unfold as the city struggles to balance its values and standards with the need to protect artistic freedom."

Alderman Michael McGee, a black politician, has gained attention for his provocative statements advocating for violence as a means of gaining respect and improving living conditions for blacks.

McGee's words have sparked outrage among some whites, with one alderman calling his demands ""extortion"" and the mayor asking him to resign. However, many black Milwaukeeans see McGee's message as empowering and are willing to take action to improve their lives. A recent study found that 40% of blacks in Milwaukee live below the poverty line, and researchers have described the city's racial segregation as ""hypersegregated.""

The article highlights the economic shift in Milwaukee over the past decade, with non-manufacturing and service jobs creating boom times for the business core, but leaving many black neighborhoods behind. It also mentions that McGee is not advocating immediate violence, but rather using the threat of it to push for change.

Some quotes from the article include:

* ""You're either in the system or you're out of it."" - Mayor John O. Norquist
* ""I'm ready to die if I have to. We can't sit back and let our neighborhoods die."" - DeJuan Johnson, a 25-year-old carpenter's aide

9004037,343895,"The landmark case involving the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) is N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama (1958). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Alabama could not force the N.A.A.C.P. to disclose its membership rolls, citing the organization's right to anonymous speech under the First Amendment.

The case has implications for the current issue in Georgia, where a law prohibits wearing masks or hoods in public. The law is being challenged by a member of the Ku Klux Klan who was arrested for violating it. The N.A.A.C.P.'s argument that anonymity can be essential to the freedom of speech is being cited as precedent.

The case raises the vexing legal issue of whether the Constitution protects the right to make public statements anonymously. A ruling in favor of the N.A.A.C.P. could have far-reaching implications for similar laws in many states, potentially broadening the scope of free speech protection under the First Amendment."

President Bush urged those present to ""continue to work for the day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question."" He also praised the anti-abortion movement as a ""humanitarian movement"" that is ""unflagging and determined.""

Vice President Quayle, in his own statement, declared that ""the pro-life movement is the humanitarian movement of our time."" He also emphasized that ""we are not losing; we are winning. We are the majority of America.""

The rally was attended by an estimated 200,000 people, although organizers claimed the crowd was much larger, with some estimates reaching as high as 700,000. The event featured music, prayer, and passionate speeches from various anti-abortion leaders.

Notably, President Bush's remarks were criticized by Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, who argued that the president's support for the anti-abortion movement threatened a fundamental American freedom: the right to choose.

The rally was part of a larger movement against abortion, with protesters also gathering outside Planned Parenthood clinics and holding prayer vigils.

* 57: Blockade, blocking by protesters (the group blocked the street and attacked the two men)
* 60: Building Take-Over (e.g., administration building) (although not explicitly mentioned, the group's takeover of the Christopher Street area can be seen as a form of protest blockade)"

Other Relevant Information:

* The proposed hotel is permitted under area zoning.
* Chatwal Hotels plans to build the hotel and has offered to give preference to local residents in employment opportunities.
* Some residents support the hotel, believing it would bring more people and spending money to the area.

- Additionally, there is a mention of black students being singled out and treated harshly in questioning by police and investigators, which could be seen as holding signs or placarding (code 20) in protest.
- The article also mentions the occupation of an administration office earlier this year to protest what was called harassment of blacks, which can be considered a form of procession or marching (not explicitly mentioned, but related to the concept).
- Finally, there is no mention of any specific protest activity that would fit into codes 1 (bannering) or 42 (singing collectively), so these codes are not applicable."

3. Chalking female symbols on sidewalks: Students chalked female symbols on the campus sidewalks, transforming the beautiful 135-acre campus into a scene reminiscent of college protests of the 1960's.

4. Shaving heads: Several students shaved their heads as a form of protest and to show their solidarity with the strike.

5. Creating an altar to ancestors: The students created an altar to their ancestors by placing photographs of alumnae on a wooden podium draped in white cloth, which was surrounded by the students' hair.

2. ""locked themselves together"" - This is an example of human bill-boarding or picketing (category 20), where individuals use their bodies to convey a message.
3. I coded this activity as 98 because it's not explicitly mentioned in the categories provided, but it appears to be some form of creative protest action that doesn't fit neatly into one of the other categories.

2. <18> Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters, signature: The four higher-education associations urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to change the Pentagon's policy, which can be considered a form of petitioning.
3. <27> Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on: The letter sent by the four groups represents their collective voices, conveying their concerns and demands through written speech.
4. <22> Procession or marching: While not explicitly mentioned in the article, the fact that the associations ""hand-delivered"" the letter suggests a possible procession or march to deliver the message, even if it's just a symbolic representation of a protest march."

* Governor Florio has proposed a bill to ban assault weapons, including semiautomatic rifles with a fixed magazine of more than 15 rounds and certain shotguns.
* The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes the bill, claiming it is an attack on the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners.
* A compromise amendment to the bill would allow some gun owners to keep their weapons if they join a target shooting organization or make their weapons inoperable.
* The bill has loopholes that would permit many gun owners to keep their weapons, but legislators say it is still a political hot potato.
* Governor Florio made banning assault weapons a campaign pledge and a defeat on the bill would be seen as a major blow to his administration.
* Some Florio aides believe identifying too closely with the issue was a mistake, coming at a time when the governor is trying to pass a budget package that raises taxes and cuts popular programs.
* The NRA has been applying heavy pressure on legislators, who are divided on the issue."

* Jack Hladik, Edison resident and member of the National Rifle Association: ""I'm not going to register anything... There are other things I'm going to do with the guns and they're not going to know about them.""

**Key Issues:**

* The protest is against the harsh sentencing of an inmate, Mr. Smith, who has been convicted of attempted murder and aggravated assault for biting a prison guard.
* Mr. Smith is infected with the AIDS virus and was not sentenced more severely because of his prior prison record or any physical harm caused by the bite.
* The American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project has condemned the sentence, saying it sends a ""wrong message"" and that the court did not consider medical evidence.
* Eight similar cases are pending around the country where people infected with AIDS have been charged with assault with intent to murder for biting or spitting.
* Curtis Weeks in Texas was sentenced to life in prison for spitting on a prison guard, while Gregory Scroggins in Georgia was sentenced to 10 years for biting a police officer.
* In Alabama, a 15-year sentence was thrown out by the State Court of Criminal Appeals due to excessive sentencing.
* A coalition of advocacy groups began chanting ""Shame! Shame!"" as the courtroom was cleared and continued their demonstration outside the courthouse.

* Tightening enforcement and permit provisions
* Protecting parks and wilderness areas from low visibility caused by nearby pollution sources

2. Bell ringing: The article mentions that hundreds of homeless people loiter in Penn Station, panhandling, stealing, sleeping on the floor and benches, and often fighting, but there is no specific reference to bell ringing.
3. Bicycling as part of a procession in protest of something: There is no mention of bicycling or any form of procession in the article.
4. Candle-lighting or carrying or displaying candles: The article does not mention candle-lighting or carrying or displaying candles.
5. Canvassing, asking for votes, signatures, money, and so on: This activity is not mentioned in the article.
6. Drive Homeless to Parks: There is no specific reference to this term in the article.
7. Sweeping people onto the streets is not the solution. Homeless people are here because it's a last resort and they have nowhere else to go,'' said Peter Smith, president of the Partnership for the Homeless.: This is a quote from an official but it does not indicate any specific action taken by them or others in the article.

9. Afraid of the Station: There is no specific reference to this term in the article.
10. The new rules also prohibit people from destroying property, littering, smoking, making unreasonable noise, occupying more than one seat, blocking free movement, endangering the safety of others, creating unsanitary conditions and entering tracks or tunnels.: These are new rules mentioned in the article but they do not indicate any specific action taken by anyone.
11. The Partnership for the Homeless called on Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M Cuomo to meet with Robert R. Kiley, the M.T.A.'s chairman: This is a call made by an organization to officials but it does not indicate any specific action taken by them or others in the article.

13. Under the new rules, railroad police plan to eject anyone who is lying down, loitering, or begging in Long Island Rail Road stations and trains.: This indicates a specific action that will be taken by the railroad police but it does not indicate any specific protest action taken by others.

The ruling concludes that the supervisors' primary objective was to protect their incumbencies and that of their allies, rather than serving the interests of the Hispanic community.

Judge Kenyon prescribed no remedy, but urged the Supervisors to consider expanding their number to allow broader representation. He scheduled a status conference with both sides on Thursday. Leaders of Mexican-American groups hailed the ruling, calling it ""a historic moment in the history of the Hispanic community.""

The decision has significant implications for politics in Los Angeles County and beyond. The Board of Supervisors is among the most powerful elected officials in the nation, supervising an annual budget of $9.6 billion and wielding influence over public health, police, welfare, and other services.

The article highlights the significance of the case, noting that even though 35% of the county's population is Hispanic, no minority candidate has ever been elected to the board. The ruling could pave the way for increased representation of Hispanic communities in local politics.

Key points from the article:

* The court decision acknowledges the explosive growth of the Hispanic community in Los Angeles County.
* The supervisors' primary objective was to protect their incumbencies and that of their allies, rather than serving the interests of the Hispanic community.

9006089,362026,"The article discusses how Republicans plan to use opposition to an amendment banning flag burning as an issue to portray Democrats as out of touch with American values. The article notes that some Democrats, such as Senator Tom Harkin, are arguing that amending the Bill of Rights is a sad and dangerous response to flag burning, while others, like Governor Dianne Feinstein, are supporting an amendment.

The article also highlights how some Democratic candidates in competitive races have already begun to embrace an amendment, blurring partisan lines. For example, Governor Ann Richards' campaign has been criticized for not being strong enough on the issue of flag burning, and she eventually came out in support of a constitutional amendment.

However, not all Democrats are embracing an amendment. Senator Paul Simon, for instance, is arguing that flag burning is clearly an outrage, but that amending the Bill of Rights is not the best way to address it. Some Democratic strategists are warning their candidates that they need to be careful in how they approach this issue, as Republicans will likely use it to attack them.

The article also notes that some conservative commentators have been vocal in their opposition to an amendment, and that some Republican officeholders are opposing an amendment as well. This has led some Democrats to argue that the issue is not as clear-cut as Republicans would like to make it out to be.

Overall, the article suggests that while the flag burning issue may be a source of controversy and debate in this year's elections, it is unlikely to be the decisive factor in many races."

9006104,362285,"**Redwood Summer Protests: Confrontational Tactics and Sabotage**

Earth First activists Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney are planning a series of demonstrations, known as Redwood Summer, to halt the logging of redwoods in Northern California. The group has little use for traditional environmentalist tactics, such as letter-writing campaigns and lawsuits, preferring confrontational demonstrations to achieve their goals.

The first major demonstration is scheduled for Wednesday, aiming to bring thousands of people to block the docks near Eureka, where Louisiana-Pacific Corporation ships rough timber to foreign countries.

**Sabotage as Self-Defense**

Darryl Cherney, a key organizer and troubadour, has advocated for sabotage activities against developers and loggers, which he calls ""ecotage."" He believes that radical steps are necessary to insure the survival of forests. When asked about his views on sabotage, he stated, ""The holocaust against the environment and its species is the same as any holocaust against humans. Civil rights for the environment are inseparable from civil rights for humans, since the environment provides us with our life support systems.""

**Concerns Among Environmental Groups**

Other environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society, have expressed concerns about Earth First's tactics, denouncing illegal actions like tree spiking (placing long metal spikes in trees to discourage logging) and sabotage. The Sierra Club has refused to endorse Redwood Summer demonstrations, citing fears of violence.

**Philosophy of Deep Ecology**

Earth First espouses a philosophy called ""deep ecology,"" which calls for the re-creation of vast areas of wilderness. Many members believe that radical steps are necessary to insure the survival of forests and the environment.

**Arrests and Injuries**

Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were injured in an explosion while transporting a bomb, which they claimed was planted by timber companies intent on stopping their activities. They have been arrested and face formal charges for possessing and transporting an explosive device.

The Redwood Summer protests are expected to continue throughout the summer, with coordinations taking place at the Mendocino Environmental Center in Ukiah."

9007005,365661,"The first moments of deliberations in the trial of Imelda Marcos resulted in a verdict of 10 to 2 in favor of acquitting her on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and mail fraud. The case against Mrs. Marcos centered around allegations that she and her husband, Ferdinand Marcos, stole over $200 million from the Philippine treasury and invested it in various assets, including real estate in Manhattan.

The jury's decision was met with jubilation by Mrs. Marcos and her supporters, who celebrated with a spontaneous birthday party for her on the courthouse steps. Mrs. Marcos herself expressed gratitude to God and the jury system, stating that she felt ""vindicated"" and ""in great awe for the jury system that symbolizes the soul of the American people.""

The verdict was seen as a victory for Mrs. Marcos, who had faced criticism and ridicule throughout the trial due to her reputation for extravagance and her husband's authoritarian rule in the Philippines. Her lawyers argued that much of the evidence presented by the prosecution was based on assumptions and half-truths, and that Mrs. Marcos was not directly involved in any illegal activities.

The acquittal was also seen as a blow to the US government, which had pursued Mrs. Marcos through extradition proceedings. The trial's surreal quality, with its daily ritual of Mrs. Marcos sitting at a table surrounded by four lawyers, wearing black mourning dress, and her frequent breakdowns in tears or collapses due to stress, added to the drama of the case.

In the end, the verdict was seen as a testament to the power of a single juror, who can sometimes outvote the entire government. As one juror, Thomas O'Rourke, put it: ""We thought the Government did a terrible, terrible job. They had half-truths and not the right witnesses. It was a terrible case."""

The state claims it has the right to lock up runaways, referring to them as ""status offenders"" who have committed non-criminal offenses like running away or violating curfew.

However, critics argue that this approach is harmful and misunderstands why these children are on the streets. They advocate for placing runaways in shelters where they can receive services and support rather than locking them up in adult facilities.

The article also mentions that some states, such as New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey, have policies that dictate that runaway and homeless juveniles should not be locked up but instead placed in shelters where they can receive help."

9007053,372640,"The article is discussing the controversy surrounding the McCarren Park pool in Brooklyn, which was closed seven years ago and has since become a symbol of community discord. The debate centers around whether to restore the pool to its original size or to modernize and reduce it.

Famous non-neighbors such as Spike Lee, Eddie Murphy, and Geraldo Rivera have taken sides on the issue, with some advocating for preservation of the historic pool and others supporting modernization and smaller pools.

The controversy has taken on racial undertones, with some arguing that the move to shrink the pool is an attempt to exclude African American and Hispanic youths from neighboring Williamsburg. Others deny these claims, stating that the issue is not about racism but rather about creating a safe and manageable recreational center for all community members.

The article highlights the long-standing conflict between those who want to preserve the original pool complex and those who support modernization and renovation. The debate has stalled construction on the pool, with no clear solution in sight.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""This is not a story of red tape run amuck, but of the problems inherent in the participatory form of government we have chosen."" - Jack Linn, assistant parks commissioner
* ""There is no reason whatsoever to destroy the wings. They are structurally sound, beautiful and functional. In another culture, another time, people would have welcomed the fact that they had an architectural treasure in their midst."" - Phyllis Yampolsky, Williamsburg artist
* ""As an African-American, I think this is racist. The pool will be so small that they could justifiably say to Latinos and African-Americans: 'It's full already. You can't get in.'"" - Mildred Tudy, educator and community board member

* The Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, announced that a new grand jury investigation will be conducted to re-examine the case of Phillip Pannell, who was shot and killed by Officer Spath.
* The decision came after it was discovered that errors were made in the post-mortem examination by the Bergen County Medical Examiner, which led to an incorrect conclusion about Mr. Pannell's actions at the time of his death.
* The new evidence centers on the bullet hole in the red coat that Mr. Pannell was wearing, which suggests that he had raised his hands before being shot.
* The case has been tainted by faulty forensic study and inaccurate autopsy analysis, leading to a deadlocked grand jury that was unable to reach an indictment.
* Community leaders are calling for a clear and unambiguous statement from the Attorney General that Mr. Pannell's hands were in the air at the time of his death.

9008022,374030,"The article discusses a case challenging Pennsylvania's abortion law, which is more restrictive than Guam's law. The ACLU is handling the case, and both sides expect it to reach the Supreme Court. The law being challenged includes requirements for women to notify their husbands before having an abortion, consent from a parent or judge for minors, pre-abortion counseling, and a 24-hour waiting period. The state presented evidence that the counseling requirements would help women understand the procedure and support options, while the ACLU argued that the procedural obstacles deny women the right to make reproductive choices independently.

The article highlights the central questions of rights at stake in the case, including:

* The psychology of battered women and whether they would use an exemption from husband notification for fear of bodily injury.
* Doctors' ability to know which cases involve ""serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily functions.""
* Procedures for computer entry of state health records to maintain confidentiality.

The ACLU argued that the procedural obstacles in Pennsylvania's law are a frontal attack on Roe v. Wade, citing previous Supreme Court decisions that found similar requirements unconstitutional. The state's attorney general, Kate L. Mershimer, believes that the court has signaled a change in its standards with the Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision, which allowed states to restrict abortions.

The case is expected to be decided within a month, and both sides are prepared to appeal if they lose. The outcome could have significant implications for reproductive rights in the United States."

9008027,374524,"This news article reports on the growing issue of language restrictions in workplaces across the United States. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has received complaints about language restrictions from various businesses, particularly those with significant numbers of minority employees who speak languages other than English.

According to the article, federal law allows workplaces to establish language restrictions only when they can show that the restrictions are justified by business necessities. However, civil rights lawyers argue that many businesses have imposed language restrictions without just cause, leading to discrimination against minority employees.

The article highlights several specific cases of language discrimination, including a complaint filed by Aida Dimaranan, a Filipino nurse who alleges that her employer, Pomona Valley Hospital, barred the use of her native language on the job. Another case involves Leonor Hernandez, a clerk-typist at Sears, Roebuck and Company who was forbidden from speaking Spanish on the job.

The article also mentions the involvement of civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) in pursuing language discrimination cases. MALDEF is reportedly investigating at least eight language-discrimination cases across several states, including California, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.

The article notes that some proponents of language restrictions argue that they are necessary to maintain a common language for conducting business efficiently, while opponents see the issue as a proxy for race or immigrant status. Overall, the article suggests that language discrimination is a growing problem in the United States, particularly in areas with significant minority populations."

9008034,374720,"Here are some key points about the annual meeting of the American Bar Association (ABA) where they voted to overturn a previous resolution supporting abortion rights:

* The ABA's House of Delegates had previously passed a resolution stating that a woman's right to an abortion was guaranteed by the Constitution, but this vote overturned that decision.
* The reversal came after 1,500 members resigned in protest over the original resolution, and many more threatened to do so, which would have cost the organization hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees.
* Some critics argued that the ABA's stance on abortion left it vulnerable to charges that its evaluations of judicial candidates could not be trusted, given its role as an advisory panel for Federal judgeships.
* The debate was intense and reflected national divisions over abortion, with some arguing that reversing precedent was bad policy and others saying that the issue should not dominate the organization's agenda.
* The vote marked a significant shift in the ABA's stance on abortion, as the House of Delegates is increasingly composed of more liberal lawyers, women, and minority members.
* Some critics argued that the reversal was a retreat from the original resolution, while others saw it as a way to avoid further division within the organization.
* The debate featured impassioned speeches from 18 members of the House of Delegates, with some arguing that the ABA should not back down on its stance in favor of abortion rights and others saying that the issue was too divisive for the organization to take a stand."
9008031,374772,"This news article is about the trial of three youths accused of raping and beating a jogger in Central Park, Manhattan. The prosecutor, Ms. Lederer, delivered a passionate closing argument, criticizing the defense's claims that the victims' statements were coerced or fabricated. She emphasized the brutality of the attack, describing how the defendants grabbed at the victim, ripped her clothes, punched her, and left her to die alone in the park.

Ms. Lederer highlighted the inconsistencies in the defendants' testimonies, pointing out that they had made contradictory statements and tried to minimize their involvement in the attack. She also ridiculed the defense's claims that the victim had not been raped or beaten, citing evidence such as twigs and leaves found inside her genital area.

The article notes that a group of about 10 spectators walked out of the courtroom during Ms. Lederer's argument, including the parents of one of the defendants, who formed a circle outside and softly sang and murmured African hymns and prayers.

This protest can be characterized as a peaceful demonstration against the prosecution's argument and potentially biased treatment of the defendants. The protesters may have been motivated by concerns about police misconduct or racial bias in the justice system."

* Corporal punishment is still prevalent in some schools, particularly in the South.
* Alternative forms of discipline, such as parent-teacher conferences, counseling, and revocation of privileges, are being used more frequently.
* Educators and parents are divided on the issue, with some arguing that paddling resolves nothing and others believing it is an effective way to discipline students.
* Lawsuits have been filed against schools for using corporal punishment, leading school districts to become more cautious about its use.
* The threat of lawsuits has contributed to a shift away from corporal punishment in some states.
* Oregon banned corporal punishment in schools due to concerns that it could perpetuate the cycle of child abuse.
* Anti-paddling groups argue that corporal punishment is not an effective way to teach students and can actually be counterproductive.
* Minority students and students with behavioral or learning disabilities are disproportionately affected by corporal punishment.

The prosecution's case relied heavily on the confessions of the three boys, which they claimed had been coerced by the police through various means. The defense argued that the confessions were false and that the police had not followed proper procedure when obtaining them.

In the end, the jury acquitted two of the boys (Salaam and Wise) of the top count, rape, but convicted them of lesser charges related to the attack. Richardson was also acquitted of the top count.

The case was highly controversial due to its racial implications and the fact that it occurred during a time of heightened racial tension in the city.

**Protest:** PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) is calling for a boycott of Nike athletic shoes due to the company's lack of diversity in its board of directors, executive team, and business relationships with black-owned companies.

**Goals:**

1. Appoint minority members to the board of directors
2. Name a black vice president
3. Increase the number of black department heads

**Tactics:**

1. Picketing athletic shoe stores to urge black families shopping for school clothes to boycott Nike
2. Boycotts have been used successfully by PUSH in affirmative action struggles with other corporations

**Key Figures:**

1. Jesse Jackson (founder of PUSH, though not directly involved in the boycott)
2. Tyrone Crider (leader of the boycott and longtime aide to Jesse Jackson)

**Target Audience:** Black families shopping for school clothes, particularly inner-city youths who are strong supporters of Nike athletic shoes.

**Potential Impact:**

1. A successful boycott could lead to significant changes in Nike's diversity and business practices.
2. A failed boycott could lead to financial difficulties and a loss of credibility for PUSH.

**Context:** The boycott is part of a broader struggle for racial equality and social justice, with PUSH seeking to hold corporations accountable for their lack of diversity and commitment to affirmative action."

**Protest Information:**

* A large-scale protest was held outside City Hall to promote racial harmony and address concerns about Mayor David N. Dinkins' perceived ineffectiveness in breaking a boycott by Korean-American business owners.
* The protest, organized by several Korean-American groups, drew thousands of participants and featured peaceful rallies and voter registration drives.
* Younger Koreans were instrumental in the protest, with many handing out voter registration forms to emphasize their growing political power.

**Community Context:**

* The Korean-American community is relatively new to the United States, dating back only two decades, and faces challenges such as limited English proficiency, lack of familiarity with American ways, and low voter registration rates.
* Despite these challenges, Korean-Americans have begun to participate more actively in local politics, endorsing Jesse Jackson in the 1988 presidential election and raising money for mayoral candidates.

**Political Landscape:**

* Korean-Americans do not appear to be wedded to either major political party, with many evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.
* Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch notes that there is a rising political consciousness among Korean-Americans and that they should not be counted out as a political force in the city.

**Future Prospects:**

* The recent protest and boycott have helped unify the Korean-American community and raise awareness about their political power.
* Many Korean-American organizations are coming together to form coalitions, advocate for their interests, and push for greater representation in local politics.
* Some young Koreans are looking ahead to 2000 as a potential benchmark year for Korean-Americans to gain more influence in city politics."

9011006,397437,"This news article reports on a landmark case involving Nancy Cruzan, a woman who has been in a vegetative state since a car accident in 1983. The case revolves around whether her feeding tube should be removed, and the High Court's ruling stating that citizens have the right to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, but with the requirement of ""clear and convincing"" evidence of an incompetent patient's wishes.

The article highlights the following key points:

1. The High Court ruled that citizens have the right to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, but state courts can require clear and convincing evidence of an incompetent patient's wishes.
2. Nancy Cruzan left no instructions regarding her end-of-life care, which has led to a lengthy legal battle.
3. The family's lawyer, William Colby, presented new testimony from three friends who claimed that Miss Cruzan had specifically said she would not want to live on medical machines if she were unable to do anything for herself.
4. The court-appointed guardian, Thad C. McCanse, produced compelling evidence in support of the family's appeal, including testimony from Dr. James C. Davis, who treats Miss Cruzan daily.
5. Dr. Davis stated that it would be a ""living hell"" for Miss Cruzan to continue her current existence and agreed with the parents' request to discontinue the feeding tube.
6. The case has sparked national interest, with requests for living will forms flooding in after the Supreme Court decision.

9011009,397471,"Here are some key points about the strike at The Daily News:

* The Newspaper Guild of New York, which represents newsroom, advertising, and circulation workers, went on strike after a seemingly minor dispute on October 25.
* Management declared that they considered themselves to have been struck by the drivers' union and began replacing 60 workers. This led to other unions following suit and going on strike as well.
* About 100 guild workers had crossed the picket line since the strike began, while management insisted the figure was closer to 400.
* Labor lawyers warned that those who returned to work risked heavy fines for strike-breaking, but noted that the United States Supreme Court had recently placed strict limits on unions' disciplinary powers.
* The paper has been able to hire only two or three permanent replacements for reporters so far, and is instead relying on temporary workers.
* Management supervisors have begun calling employees at other local papers with job offers, and have placed advertisements in several newspapers asking applicants to reply to a post office box.
* Despite management's claims that the press run was the largest since the strike began, relatively few newsstands in New York City appeared to be selling The News. Industry experts estimated that only around 200,000 copies were being sold per day, compared to the paper's usual circulation of over 1 million.
* Some homeless people have begun hawking stolen copies of the paper on the streets, with one vendor selling 50 copies for a quarter each in less than an hour.

Overall, it appears that The Daily News is facing significant challenges as a result of the strike, including difficulties in getting the paper to its readers and a loss of circulation."

2. A 20-year-old student, Michael Lindell, died after shooting himself in the head at his family's home hours before he was scheduled to meet with state police to discuss what he saw that night in the fraternity house.
3. The woman who accused Dave Lallemand of sexual assault testified at a bail hearing that she was not certain that Mr. Lallemand had assaulted her because she had been drinking heavily the day of the party.
4. The incident has sparked a campus protest, with about 200 women staging a vigil demanding more safety measures.
5. The university has taken steps to address concerns about sexual assault on campus, including warning freshmen during orientation about campus rape and considering creating an alcohol-free campus.

Some possible themes or messages that may be present in this case include:

1. The importance of taking allegations of sexual assault seriously and conducting thorough investigations.
2. The need for universities to prioritize student safety and take steps to prevent sexual assaults from occurring on campus.
3. The complexity and nuance of cases involving allegations of sexual assault, which can involve issues of consent, memory, and the impact of alcohol consumption.
4. The importance of supporting victims of sexual assault and providing them with resources and support.
5. The need for universities to address broader societal issues, such as the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses and the need for increased awareness and education about these issues."

9011027,401623,"Protest Information Extraction:

**Event:** Hasidim protest at 90th Precinct station house

**Date:** Last month

**Description:** Approximately 300 Hasidim demonstrated outside the precinct to protest the arrest of a sect member on sexual assault charges. The protest turned violent, resulting in 45 police officers injured and one protester charged with assaulting an officer.

**Accusations:**

* The Hasidim are pushing non-Jewish residents out of their community to create an exclusive enclave.
* Police favoritism towards the Hasidic community, including not issuing parking summonses on predominantly Hasidic blocks and refusing to arrest Hasidic suspects accused of crimes.
* The police department is afraid to act against the Hasidim for fear of upsetting the community.

**Community Tensions:**

* The competition over limited housing available in the area has led to incredible tensions between the Hispanic and Hasidic communities.
* Rumors have spread about the Hasidim having an inside track on federally subsidized apartments, leading to resentment and mistrust.

**Challenges:**

* Housing advocates claim that the city is in contempt of a 1977 consent decree that aimed to increase the number of Hispanic families living in certain NYCHA projects.
* The development of land purchased by Hasidic groups has been challenged unsuccessfully by housing advocates, who argue that the plans are inappropriate on land originally chosen for urban renewal.

**Community Concerns:**

* Some residents have reported instances of Hasidic men making lewd remarks and propositioning minority women, as well as members of a Hasidic volunteer security patrol engaging in vigilante attacks on minority men.
* The Hispanic community fears that the Hasidim are trying to displace them and create an exclusive enclave.

**Leadership Responses:**

* Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown visited the area to clear the air and allay fears, stating that no dual standard of justice exists and that an investigation is continuing to examine the Hasidic protest at the station house.
* City Councilman Abraham G. Gerges is putting together an advisory council composed of community representatives to develop strategies for addressing housing and development issues.

**Overall Sentiment:** The tensions between the Hispanic and Hasidic communities are running high, with many residents expressing frustration and resentment towards the Hasidim's perceived attempts to displace them."

**Protest Type:** Demonstration by scores of parents, including chanting slogans and marching with posters

**Number of Protesters:** Swelled to 100 parents at midmorning

**Duration:** Lasted for hours before ending before noon

**Objectives:**

* To support Dr. Guberman, the former teacher-turned-acting principal
* To protest the board's decision to replace him
* To demand a change in the school leadership

**Reasons for Protesting:**

* Parents believed that Dr. Guberman had improved teacher and pupil morale, test scores, special education classes, and parental involvement during his 16-month tenure as acting principal.
* They claimed that the board's decision was based on political and personal reasons rather than educational ones.

**Notable Quotes:**

* ""I'm here because I want that man to be my daughter's principal. They have done a great injustice."" - Cathy Vaz, parent
* ""Power, personality, and racism"" were all elements of the dispute, according to Marion Rose, board member.
* ""Why do these parents like him so much? They don't even know what is going on. They are just being led by a small group of people. These children need every day they can get in school."" - Melvina R. Smith, board member.

* Parents vowed to continue protesting and threatened to file a lawsuit to support Dr. Guberman.
* The protest was part of a larger effort to rally community support for the ousted principal."
9012016,409712,"The article highlights the remarkable self-governance of the homeless community in Seattle's bus barn shelter, which is managed entirely by its residents without external supervision. This unique approach has led to a peaceful, organized, and sober community that is able to tackle its own problems and make decisions collectively.

The residents of the bus barn have developed an unruly democracy, with rotating chairmen and a devotion to Robert's Rules of Order. They discuss important issues such as attendance at meetings, weapons policy, sleeping arrangements, and committee elections. This level of autonomy and participation has allowed them to take control of their own lives and make decisions that benefit the community.

The article also notes that this self-governed approach could serve as a model for other shelters across the country, allowing residents to take charge of their own destinies rather than relying on external authorities. As Chris Sprowal, president of the Association for Dignity and Fairness for the Homeless in Philadelphia, said, ""This teaches them to begin to fight on their own behalf.""

The article highlights the success of this approach, citing the lack of conflict or violence within the community, as well as the donations and support they have received from the public. The residents' ability to work together and make decisions has earned them respect and admiration from both the city officials and the general public.

Overall, the article showcases the remarkable achievements of the homeless community in Seattle's bus barn shelter, demonstrating their capacity for self-organization, cooperation, and problem-solving."

* The petition demands that the FDA:

	+ Expedite its review of the data and use laboratory test results, such as increasing numbers of immune system cells or drops in viral proteins, as evidence that the drugs are working.

**Background:**

* The petition is led by Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, with support from AIDS advocates.
* The goal is to speed up the approval process for DDI and DDC, two experimental AIDS drugs.

**Key Quotes:**

* Dr. Sidney Wolfe (Public Citizen): ""I hope the FDA takes it seriously.""
* Donald McLearn (FDA spokesman): ""The FDA has, in the case of AIDS, adapted its system a great deal in the last few years... We are very flexible.""
* William Vodra (former associate chief counsel for drugs at the FDA): There is a precedent for the FDA calling in a company's data.
* Brian Wolfman (Public Citizen lawyer): The group is ""very much interested in making sure the FDA responds and devotes enough resources to the problem.""

**Notable Organizations:**

* Public Citizen
* Project Inform
* Act-Up (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power)
* Community Consortium (group of 180 doctors who treat AIDS patients in the San Francisco area)

**Concerns:**

* Advocates are concerned that data being gathered in trials of DDI and DDC will not provide definitive answers any time soon.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. ""The government interest in historic preservation, though worthy, is not sufficiently compelling to justify restraints on the free exercise of religion..."" - This suggests that there was a protest or debate (category 8) about the landmark designation and its impact on religious freedom.
2. ""...the court agreed, citing the Massachusetts constitution."" - This implies that there may have been some kind of public display or demonstration (category 20) in support of the Jesuits' case.
3. ""Preservationists and religious groups are increasingly at odds..."" - This suggests that there may have been some kind of public disagreement or confrontation (category 2?) between these two groups, which could be characterized as a protest.

9101005,412518,"This article reports on the growing concern about acquaintance rape on college campuses. The issue has led to changes in women's attitudes towards sexual activity, with many women now feeling empowered to say ""no"" and set boundaries. However, men are also being socialized to understand that ""no"" means ""no"" and to respect a woman's decision not to engage in sexual activity.

The article highlights the importance of education and communication on campus. Many colleges and universities are implementing programs to educate students about acquaintance rape, including seminars, lectures, and support services for victims. Some institutions are also forming men-only discussion groups to encourage males to take responsibility for their actions and to understand the impact of their behavior on others.

The article also notes that insurance companies are taking notice of the issue, with some predicting higher rates for colleges in the near future due to the increased risk of campus crime, including acquaintance rape. However, the article suggests that efforts to educate students about consent and respect can help reduce the incidence of acquaintance rape and promote a safer and more respectful campus culture.

Some key quotes from the article include:

* ""You put yourself in a vulnerable position and it's your own fault."" - This is an outdated attitude towards rape, which is now recognized as a serious violation that should not be attributed to the victim.
* ""It's very common. That's why it's so scary."" - Many women report experiencing pressure or coercion from men who assume consent for sexual activity.
* ""You can say no, but the guy keeps going. Then the girl finds herself in a situation she doesn't know how to deal with."" - This highlights the importance of clear communication and respect for a woman's boundaries.
* ""It's O.K. to say yes, but whether it is 'yes' or 'no,' women need to be forceful and clear in their signals, both spoken and non-spoken, to avoid situations in which they become vulnerable."" - This emphasizes the importance of consent and communication in sexual encounters.
* ""When things start moving quickly, that's the time to get out, move fast, kick up a fuss."" - This quote suggests that women should take proactive steps to protect themselves and assert their boundaries if necessary.

Overall, this article highlights the need for education, communication, and respect on college campuses to prevent acquaintance rape and promote a safer and more respectful culture."
9101006,412518,"This article discusses the growing issue of acquaintance rape on college campuses, particularly among women who are victims of sexual assault by someone they know or have a relationship with. The article highlights the changing attitudes towards what constitutes forced sex and how society's willingness to discuss rape has increased. It also emphasizes the importance of educating both men and women about consent, communication, and respect.

The article mentions that some insurance companies are now unwilling to cover universities from litigation stemming from ""illegal sexual activity,"" including rapes on campus. This is because the risk of insuring institutions becomes too great if they do not take proactive measures to prevent and address these incidents.

The article also highlights the need for men to be educated about what constitutes consent and how to respect a woman's boundaries. Many men have been conditioned to believe that initial refusals are an essential part of a ""mating game"" ritual, which can lead to misunderstandings about what a woman means by saying ""no.""

The article notes that many colleges and universities are now taking steps to address the issue of acquaintance rape through campus education programs, improved reporting mechanisms, men-only discussion groups, and better legal and counseling support. Some institutions have even implemented measures such as providing escort services for women or banning liquor from campus.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of addressing this complex issue by educating both men and women about consent, communication, and respect, and by taking proactive steps to prevent and address incidents of acquaintance rape on college campuses."

1. The insurance industry is concerned about the growing risk of litigation related to acquaintance rape on college campuses.
2. Many college women report feeling pressured into sexual activity or experiencing unwanted advances, often due to a lack of clear communication about consent.
3. Some men are unaware that initial refusals can be a sign of true rejection and may continue to pursue sex despite a woman's ""no"" meaning ""no.""
4. University administrators and counselors emphasize the importance of women being forceful and clear in their signals, both spoken and non-spoken, to avoid situations where they become vulnerable.

9101004,412626,"This article describes a controversy at San Francisco State University involving the political science department and the School of Ethnic Studies. Professor Smith, a new hire in the political science department, was offered a course on black politics that duplicated a similar course already being taught by the chairman of the black studies department, Oba T'Shaka.

The controversy arose because some saw Professor Smith's course as an attack on ethnic studies and an attempt to drain students from the School of Ethnic Studies. Professor Smith maintained that his course did not constitute an attack on ethnic studies and gave legitimacy to the subject.

The article highlights the tension between traditional departments and specialized ethnic studies programs, with some seeing the growth of minority faculty and courses as a threat to the dominance of traditional disciplines. The controversy also raises questions about the role of ethnic studies in higher education and whether they should be separate departments or folded into traditional departments.

Some quotes from experts and individuals involved in the controversy include:

* Alexander W. Astin, director of the Higher Education Research Institute: ""Given their marginal status, ethnic studies has a justifiable sense of paranoia.""
* Professor Smith: ""It is very difficult to oppose black people without being called racist... It's easier to see someone like myself as an Uncle Tom.""
* Oba T'Shaka: ""Just as you have physics or science departments that deal with the disciplines of science, so you also need departments that have scholars who have devoted their lives to work in the scholarly disciplines of Afro-American, native American and La Raza studies.""

Overall, the article suggests that the controversy at San Francisco State University reflects a broader trend in higher education, where there is an increasing tension between traditional departments and specialized ethnic studies programs."
9101010,412969,"Based on the article, I would categorize the following protest activities:

1. 21 ; 28 ; 29 = praying; sloganeering (repeating slogans); and protesting (demonstrating) against the policy.

These categories are based on the descriptions of protests and demonstrations by AIDS organizations, international societies, and health ministers from foreign governments. The article mentions that protesters called for a boycott at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco, which could be categorized as sloganeering or protesting. Additionally, some officials mentioned that people with the AIDS virus were barred from entering this country to attend scientific conferences and other meetings, which implies that there was also praying or religious activities involved in these protests."

16 ; 28 ; 29 ; 97

Explanation:
16: Meditation (ordinarily silent) - The Rabbi is outraged and wants a response from Madonna, indicating meditation or silence on the issue.
28: Sloganeering/Chanting - The phrase ""synagogue of Satan"" is repeated in the article, which can be seen as sloganeering or chanting anti-Semitic sentiments.
29: Vigiling (silent protest) - The Rabbi's letter to Madonna's manager expresses outrage and a desire for a response, indicating a silent vigil or protest against the perceived anti-Semitic message.
97: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers - Although not explicitly stated in the article, it can be inferred that Rabbi Cooper might consider taking legal action if Madonna does not retract her statement."

* The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has awarded $20,000 to Haleakala Inc. (known as ""The Kitchen"") and another New York organization, the Downtown Art Company, for new performance works that explore mental illness and contemporary issues.
* One of the grants goes to a collaborative work by Karen Finley and composer Jerry Hunt, which will use a talk-show format to explore mental illness.
* The other grant is in support of a new performance work by Ms. Hughes and Ellen Sebastian, director, which will ""draw on ancient non-Western traditions to explore several contemporary issues.""
* Both grants were recommended by the NEA's grant review panel and approved last November by the National Council for the Arts, but had been denied previously.
* The denial of grants to performance artists Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, along with two other artists, was criticized as political interference in art.
* The controversy led to a lawsuit against the NEA, which is still pending in Federal District Court in Los Angeles.
* The new legislation has shifted more grant money to state arts councils and requires that agency grants be ""sensitive to the general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American people.""
* Some arts administrators have welcomed the recent announcement as a trend towards supporting innovative art, but others remain critical of the NEA's decision-making process."
9101013,413093,"The protest is about the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey asking for a $1 toll increase on Hudson River crossings and a 25-cent increase in PATH fares to pay off their debts, which have accumulated to $22 billion. The authorities claim they are being unfairly criticized as part of the growing anti-tax and anti-government sentiment in New Jersey.

The protesters argue that the majority of people are unaware of how their money is being spent by these independent authorities and demand accountability from Governor Florio. They believe a protest on the New Jersey Turnpike could cause gridlock if he doesn't address the issue.

Additionally, there have been concerns raised about the spending practices of other public authorities in New Jersey, such as the Delaware River Port Authority, which has spent $285,000 on foreign and domestic trips since 1987. The agency also has offices abroad and spends $3.5 million annually to market the Philadelphia area ports.

The protesters are calling for Governor Florio to take control of these independent authorities and ensure that their spending practices are transparent and accountable."

9101015,413635,"The text describes the growing activism around breast cancer, particularly among women who have been affected by the disease. The article highlights the parallels between the breast cancer movement and the AIDS activism of the 1980s, which successfully lobbied for more research funding, improved treatment options, and increased public awareness.

Key points:

1. Breast cancer affects one in 11 American women and is a leading cause of death among women.
2. Advocacy groups are pushing for more government funding for research, insurance coverage for mammograms, and experimental treatments.
3. The breast cancer movement is drawing inspiration from the AIDS activism of the 1980s, which successfully lobbied for increased funding and awareness.
4. Breast cancer advocates have already achieved success on the state level, requiring insurance companies to pay for mammograms.
5. Federal health officials note that breast cancer receives more government funding than any other cancer type, including lung cancer, which claims more lives each year.
6. The National Cancer Institute has recently conceded that women have not been properly represented in biomedical research, and advocates are pushing for greater representation.
7. The activism around breast cancer is fueled by demographics, as the baby boom generation grows older and faces health issues, including breast cancer.

Overall, the article highlights the growing momentum of the breast cancer movement and its parallels with the successful AIDS activism of the 1980s."
9101016,413635,"Here are some potential actions related to breast cancer:

* Lobbying for more money for research: Breast cancer groups are pushing for increased funding for research into the causes and treatment of breast cancer.
* Broader insurance coverage for mammograms: Groups are advocating for broader insurance coverage for mammograms, which can help detect breast cancer early on.
* Resumption of stalled studies: Some researchers have been unable to continue their studies due to lack of funding. Breast cancer groups are pushing for the resumption of these studies.

These actions are being taken at both the state and federal levels. At the state level, some insurance companies have already been required to cover mammograms. 

The inspiration for this activism comes from the success of AIDS activists in bringing attention and resources to that disease."
9101018,413778,"After reading the article, I've identified four protest activities:

16 ; 18 ; 20 ; 28

Here's a brief explanation for each activity:

* 16: Meditation - The advocacy group is criticizing the governor's actions and inactions regarding AIDS funding, which implies a sense of frustration or disapproval that might be expressed through meditation.
* 18: Petitioning - The article mentions that social-services lobbyists will sound alarms against state budget cuts, which suggests that petitioning (petitioning for increased Federal dollars for HIV education, prevention, and treatment) is an activity that may occur.
* 20: Holding signs - The article quotes Timothy J. Sweeney, executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis, as saying ""Imagine the outcry that would have come from California's Governor if San Francisco had been denied aid after the earthquake."" This statement implies that holding signs or engaging in other forms of protest may occur.
* 28: Sloganeering/Chanting - The article does not explicitly mention sloganeering or chanting, but it does quote Mr. Sweeney as saying ""Though New York has a full quarter of the nation's AIDS cases, the Governor has yet to pay a high-profile visit to Washington to rally support for increased Federal dollars for HIV education, prevention and treatment."" This statement could potentially be chanted or used in sloganeering during a protest.

Please note that these activities are not necessarily direct quotes from the article but rather my interpretation based on the text."
9101022,414502,"This article reports on a controversy surrounding Judge Broadman's order to force a 27-year-old woman, Darlene Johnson, who has four children and is pregnant, to have an implant called Norplant that prevents pregnancy. The judge's order was part of Ms. Johnson's probation following her guilty plea to several counts of felony child abuse.

The lawyer representing Ms. Johnson, Mr. Rothbaum, announced that he would appeal the judge's decision and seek the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in arguing that the government has no right to dictate birth control use.

Judge Broadman defended his order by stating that it was constitutionally supportable because the state had a compelling interest in protecting any children Ms. Johnson may have not yet conceived. He also noted that Ms. Johnson had agreed to the implant at first, and that he welcomed the opportunity for a higher court to consider the matter.

The judge's order has created a stir among medical ethicists and civil rights activists who question the right of the state to dictate birth control decisions. Mr. Rothbaum likened the implant to a thought control device from science fiction films, and argued that it was not related to rehabilitation or the original crime of child abuse.

The controversy raises questions about the government's role in controlling individuals' reproductive choices, particularly in cases where there may be concerns about the ability of a parent to care for their children. The judge's order has been met with skepticism by some who see it as an overreach by the state into personal decisions.

Some have also raised concerns that the implant could be used as a means of population control or to target specific groups, such as welfare recipients or individuals with disabilities. The inventor of Norplant, Sheldon J. Segal, has expressed similar concerns about the potential misuse of the device.

Overall, this case highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding reproductive rights, government oversight, and individual autonomy."

9101074,417317,"This article reports on a landmark court case in Florida where a judge ruled that a shipyard's ""boys' club"" atmosphere, which included pinup calendars and explicit sexual remarks, created a hostile work environment for women. The court ordered the shipyard to institute a comprehensive sexual harassment policy and pay the legal fees of the plaintiff, Lois Robinson.

The article describes the evidence presented in the case, including 30 pornographic pictures displayed at the shipyard, which included images of women's genitals and breasts. The verbal harassment included explicit sexual remarks and teasing. Two other female employees testified that they too were subjected to frequent sexual harassment.

Judge Melton found that the shipyard had a pre-existing atmosphere that deterred women from entering or continuing in their profession, and that this was just as damaging as a sign declaring ""men only."" The court ruled that the company's previous policy prohibiting abuse of dignity through sexist slurs was ineffective and that many employees were unaware of it.

The case is significant because it highlights the prevalence of sexual harassment in male-dominated industries and the need for comprehensive policies to address this issue. The ruling also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the impact of gender stereotypes on women's experiences in the workplace.

Women's rights lawyers hailed the decision as an important advance for women in construction jobs, which have historically been held by men. The case is seen as a key step towards achieving greater equality and respect for women in these industries."
9101076,418014,"The protest information I can extract from this news article are:

* A new law in Utah restricts most abortions, with an exemption only for cases where the pregnant woman's life is endangered.
* Guam has passed a more restrictive law allowing abortion only when the woman's life is at risk.
* Pennsylvania's law, which imposed procedural obstacles to abortion, was found unconstitutional by a federal district court and is now on appeal to the Supreme Court.
* Several other states are considering or have already passed restrictive abortion laws, including Missouri, South Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio.
* The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood, and other groups backing abortion rights have promised to challenge Utah's law in court and are also threatening to block Utah's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics if the law is upheld.

These protests aim to defend women's right to abortion and privacy, as well as the Roe v. Wade decision, which has been challenged by various state laws seeking to restrict or ban abortions."

9103006,428334,"A significant event has occurred in Los Angeles, involving a 25-year-old man named King who was brutally beaten by police officers after being stopped for speeding. The incident was captured on videotape and shows over a dozen officers taking turns beating King with nightsticks and kicking him.

King was released from jail earlier today without charges being filed against him, looking bruised and battered. He described the incident to reporters, saying he was scared for his life and tried to cooperate with the police. Witnesses also corroborated King's account, stating that he did not fight back but instead pleaded with the officers to stop hitting him.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has launched an internal investigation into the incident, which has sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, and the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division are also investigating the matter.

The FBI is conducting a civil rights inquiry, while the District Attorney's office is considering filing criminal charges. Mayor Tom Bradley has called for a thorough investigation and demanded that the police officers involved be taken off field duty pending the outcome of the investigations.

The incident has sparked concerns about police brutality and racial profiling in Los Angeles, with many calling it an ""aberration"" rather than an isolated incident. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights organizations have joined in condemning the violence and demanding accountability from the LAPD.

It is worth noting that this is not the first instance of police brutality or racial profiling in Los Angeles, with several high-profile cases having occurred in recent years.

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other groups are trying to block the killings)
* 26: Silence references to deliberate, designated periods of silence, silent worship, silent vigil (the animal rights group has been trying for years to gain legal custody of the monkeys)
* 27: Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on (United States Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy granted a petition from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group)

9104009,436967,"Based on the article, I code up to 4 protest activities:

20 ; 28 ; 98 ; 99

Here's my reasoning:

1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20): The Fund for Animals sued to prevent the killings, which is a form of peaceful protest.
2. Sloganeering/chanting (28): Although not explicitly stated in the article, it's likely that some slogans were chanted during the protests.
3. Other activity (98): The Fund for Animals' efforts to stop the killings can be considered an ""other"" type of protest activity.
4. Missing activity (99): There is no explicit mention of other types of protest activities, such as marches or rallies, in the article.

* Activity 2: Speechmaking (27) - The hospital spokeswoman, Michele DeMilly, said the hospital ""will never discriminate in the provision of health care services."" Marianne Engelman Lado, an N.A.A.C.P. fund lawyer, called St. Luke's offer to keep beds for mothers and infants ""an empty promise.""
* Activity 3: Holding signs (20) - No specific mention of holding signs, but the article describes local opponents' protests against the hospital center's modernization plan.
* Activity 4: Other activity (98) - The article discusses various issues related to the protest, including the hospital's claims and counter-claims, without specifically mentioning any additional protest activities."

9104012,437733,"The era of official segregation in public elementary and secondary schools came to an end with a Supreme Court ruling. However, there is still debate about whether the same standards should apply to higher education institutions. The court will now consider a case that challenges Mississippi's policy on desegregation in its colleges and universities.

The issue at hand is whether Mississippi has fulfilled its constitutional obligation to integrate its institutions of higher education. The state argues that it has done so by discontinuing discriminatory practices and adopting race-neutral policies. However, the private plaintiffs argue that vestiges of segregation remain, citing faculty and staff members who are still clustered by race, lower admission standards at historically black colleges, and greater financial resources available to white schools.

The case will be a significant test of whether the same standards apply to higher education institutions as those applied to elementary and secondary schools. The court has accepted an appeal from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which had dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that while the guards had used excessive force, they had inflicted only negligible injuries.

In related news, the Justice Department is supporting historically black colleges with grants and loans for equipment, research, and student financial aid. The policy has been criticized by some who argue it could be seen as inconsistent with the court's decision on desegregation in higher education institutions."

1. 20; 2. 17; 3. 31

Here's why:

* ""Black arm bands"" and ""carrying placards"" refer to protesters holding signs (category 20).
* The article mentions that some students wore black arm bands during the meeting, which implies that they were protesting the article.
* There is no direct mention of bell ringing or cross carrying, so these categories are not applicable.

9104018,438098,"This article discusses a strike by railroad workers against 10 major freight companies and 88 smaller lines, involving approximately 235,000 workers. The strike began after negotiations broke down and mediation efforts failed.

Key points:

1. The strike was called after the National Mediation Board was unable to mediate the dispute.
2. Congress intervened, passing legislation aimed at resolving the labor-management issue.
3. Union leaders were initially opposed to congressional intervention, preferring to settle their own issues through collective bargaining.
4. Some businesses, such as utilities and builders, had stockpiled supplies to minimize disruptions, while others, like the automobile industry, did not.
5. The strike affected coal shipments, with some mines having limited storage capacity, potentially leading to layoffs of thousands of miners.
6. General Motors estimated that 75-80% of its production would be impacted within 24 hours, which could lead to widespread layoffs.
7. Commuters were initially unaffected, but CalTrain services between San Jose and San Francisco were shut down shortly after the strike began.
8. Amtrak continued service along certain corridors with the consent of the freight lines that own the tracks.
9. The strike involved eight or nine unions, with some settling their issues through collective bargaining before the strike.

The main issues leading to the strike include:

1. The number of workers needed to run a train (four or five vs. two).
2. How far a worker must travel to be credited for working a full day (108 miles vs. 100-200 miles).

The strike highlights the challenges faced by railroads and their employees in negotiating collective bargaining agreements, as well as the potential economic impacts of labor disputes on industries that rely heavily on rail transportation."

9104026,441188,"Based on this news article, I've extracted the following protest information:

**Protest Location:** The occupied schoolroom is located on the second floor of a rubber factory.

**Reason for Protest:** The students are protesting against the forced eviction from their school, La Nueva Raza, due to an unpaid rent of $34,000. They have been trying to find alternative solutions and have even met with politicians, including Deputy Mayor Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, but have been unsuccessful.

**Protest Tactics:** The students are using a variety of tactics to protest the eviction, including:

* Organizing committees to meet with the building's owner and City Hall officials
* Sending form letters to dozens of politicians, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, asking for help
* Holding off the landlord and Board of Education movers with a locked door during their first skirmish
* Playing Ping Pong and joking while planning strategy
* Standing guard behind the wire-mesh front entrance

**Protest Demands:** The students are demanding that they be allowed to continue operating La Nueva Raza, which provides an alternative education for students who have been unsuccessful in traditional schools. They argue that their program is working and has helped many students turn their lives around.

**Background Information:**

* La Nueva Raza was founded by Rafael Cantellops and started with his own money in 1981.
* The school has received funding from the state, but this was canceled last year due to issues with documentation and management.
* The school's founder, Rafael Cantellops, has been accused of mismanaging funds and granting contracts to friends, including the director of La Nueva Raza.
* The students have tried talking with politicians and school officials before deciding on a takeover.

**Key Quotes:**

* ""We've worked so hard to finally be something, and they just want to take it from right underneath our feet."" - Salea, 19-year-old student
* ""So far, this is the only plan that's really working."" - Salea, 19-year-old student
* ""I feel sorry for them. I understand they have a hard problem, but we're not a charity organization. I hate to put it that way, but I just can't afford to let them stay."" - Herbert Hebel, owner of Pilot Products"

9105002,442188,"Here's the extracted protest information:

**Event:** The New Jersey State Medical Society voted to support universal testing of hospital patients for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

**Date:** No specific date mentioned in the article.

**Location:** The conference was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

**Organizers:** The New Jersey State Medical Society and its president, Dr. Riggs.

**Participants:** Physicians attending the conference, including Dr. McShane, a plastic surgeon from Glen Ridge.

**Groups opposed to the policy:** Homosexual rights groups, including the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund (represented by Evan Wolfson) and Gay Men's Health Crisis (represented by David Hansell).

**Concerns raised:**

1. Mandatory testing for doctors would lead to mandatory testing for patients.
2. The policy would institutionalize discrimination against people infected with HIV.
3. It would expose HIV-positive patients to inferior treatment and segregation.
4. Negative test results can be deceptive, making it difficult to determine who is truly infected.
5. The policy could increase the danger of infection to doctors and others.
6. People already experience difficulty in obtaining medical and dental care, and this policy would make it worse.

**Key quotes:**

1. ""I just think it is going to show hospital staff and the people that we are serious about this disease... We have got to put a handle on this disease."" - Dr. Riggs
2. ""It is an invitation to segregate out a group of patients and expose them to discrimination and inferior treatment."" - Evan Wolfson, Lambda Legal Defense Fund

9105006,442944,"A fascinating article about the protests surrounding the filming of ""Basic Instinct""!

It appears that the gay community and other groups have been protesting against the perceived negative images of lesbians and women in the screenplay. The protesters are upset about the portrayal of lesbian and bisexual characters as murderers, and feel that the script is dishonest, dangerous, and trash.

The article mentions a meeting between the filmmakers, city officials, and representatives from various groups, including the National Organization for Women, Community United Against Violence, Queer Nation, and Act-Up. As a result of this meeting, the screenwriter, Joe Eszterhas, agreed to revise the script to reflect the sensitivities expressed by the gay community leaders.

However, it seems that the director, Paul Verhoeven, and producer, Alan Marshall, have rejected these changes, citing concerns about undermining the strength of the original material and weakening the characters. This has led to tensions between the film crew and protesters, with 25 demonstrators arrested for violating a restraining order obtained by the filmmakers.

The article also touches on the issue of sensitivity training in Hollywood studios, with some creative departments beginning sessions with members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance. This is an important step towards promoting greater understanding and representation of LGBTQ+ individuals in the media.

It will be interesting to see how this controversy unfolds, particularly given the high-profile nature of the film and its cast."

* 28: Sloganeering/chanting: While there are no specific slogans or chants mentioned in the article, it's possible that protesters might have used slogans like ""Keep abortion legal"" or ""Church should tolerate different views"".

9105013,443563,"A fascinating piece! It seems that General Norman Schwarzkopf, also known as ""Stormin' Norman,"" has become a media and marketing phenomenon since his return from the Persian Gulf war. The article highlights the various ways in which he is being celebrated, including a parade, a ""Draft General Schwarzkopf"" campaign, and even a discount on submarine sandwiches at a Tampa restaurant.

The article also touches on the question of whether General Schwarzkopf will run for political office. While some people are urging him to consider a Senate seat in 1992, others believe that he should not enter politics. The general himself has expressed no desire to enter politics, saying ""I do not envision myself as a political candidate.""

It's interesting to note the different reactions to General Schwarzkopf's celebrity status. While some people are enthusiastic about his popularity and see it as a symbol of patriotism, others are more skeptical, questioning whether all the attention is worth it.

Overall, this article provides a glimpse into the media frenzy surrounding General Schwarzkopf and the various ways in which he is being celebrated. It also highlights the different opinions and perspectives on whether he should consider entering politics."

**Police Response**: Police fired tear gas and used buses to transport officers into the area; a curfew was imposed at midnight

**Leadership Response**: Mayor Dixon declared a state of emergency, promised an investigation into complaints of police harassment, and vowed to improve communication with the Hispanic community. She also welcomed suggestions for a special commission to study Hispanic needs.

2. Protest Activity 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - Opposed parents possibly displayed signs or held a picket line outside the school.
3. Protest Activity 26: Silence (deliberate, designated periods of silence, silent worship, silent vigil) - Some students may have been upset by the memorial and remained silent as a form of protest.
4. Protest Activity 97: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers (e.g., trial, filing brief, etc.) - The lawsuit filed by about 90 parents to halt the construction of the memorial is an example of this type of protest activity."
9105022,446270,"Here are the main points:

**Ethnic Worlds**

* Many students on American college campuses create ""ever more complete worlds"" of their own, where they live, study, and socialize only with others like themselves.
* This phenomenon is increasing racial and ethnic separatism, leading to dissonance and misunderstanding between different groups.

**Implications**

* The college campus is a crucible for tomorrow's society, and if humanism and communal understanding can't happen there, how can it happen in the wider world?
* Separatism has existed for decades, but the problem has intensified since the 1960s as minority enrollment has risen.
* Some universities are trying to address this issue through social engineering experiments.

**Examples**

* Stanford University has four special ethnic dorms, with a twist: no more than half of the students living in each dorm can belong to the theme group. The rest must be from other groups.
* Cornell University has a Ujaama House for African-American students and is building a small dorm with an American Indian theme.
* Oberlin College has set aside dorms for African-American, Hispanic, and Jewish students.

**New Racial Awareness**

* As minority enrollment rises, racial awareness intensifies, leaving students struggling to deal with the racial realities they had never encountered.
* Some students want to experience different cultures but have trouble understanding the actions of other groups and often segregate themselves for self-defense or mutual support.

**Social Transformation**

* One expert suggests that campus fragmentation could lead to a social transformation: a society without a dominant group, capable of working in the multicultural world economy that is now forming.
* The key is not ""How can I be like you?"" but rather ""How can I understand you?"""

* On Saturday night, three white men (Shannon Siegel, Ian Pearl, and James Peralta) were arrested and charged in the beating of Jermaine on an Atlantic Beach, L.I., boardwalk.
* The police described the attack as racially motivated.
* According to witnesses, Jermaine was attacked from behind with wooden sticks and baseball bats while sitting on a railing overlooking the ocean.
* The attackers allegedly targeted Jermaine because he was talking to a white girl at a graduation party earlier that night.
* Jermaine's godmother, Tamara Steckler, said that his mother did not feel the attack represented the community, indicating that Jermaine and his family were well-respected members of society.

These details highlight the egregious nature of this hate crime, which was motivated by racial bigotry. The fact that Jermaine was targeted for talking to a white girl at a party, and then brutally beaten in front of witnesses, underscores the extreme prejudice involved."

9107019,459918,"Based on the article, here's how the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) calculates their overtime pay for news writers and producers:

* News writers and producers at NBC are paid a base salary with varying fees added for different categories of writers and producers.
* Overtime is paid only on the base salary, not on the fees.
* The base pay was $895 a week before changes were made, and fees ranged up to about $260 a week.
* A producer making the maximum fee would have received almost $10 more an hour on overtime if the fees were included in the computation.

However, the dispute revolves around whether news writers and producers are professionals exempt from overtime payments. NBC argues that they are professionals who exercise judgment and discretion in determining what is newsworthy and how to present stories through a blend of words, pictures, sound, and graphics. On the other hand, the news writers and producers claim that their work is mundane and uncreative, and therefore, not exempt from overtime payments.

The outcome of this dispute will depend on whether the court rules that NBC's news writers and producers are professionals or not."

In the quaint village of Jaffrey, New Hampshire, a controversy has unfolded over a store owner's decision to display reproductions of racist memorabilia in his shop window. The items, which date from the mid-1800s to the early 20th century, include dolls, advertisements, and postcards bearing caricatures of African Americans.

The debate has sparked heated discussions among residents, with some calling for the removal of these offensive artifacts while others believe they should be allowed to remain on display as a historical representation of a painful past.

At the center of the controversy is Mr. Breen, the store owner who has refused to remove the items despite pressure from local officials and residents. He claims that his right to free speech is being violated and that he is not motivated by racism.

Meanwhile, a growing number of African Americans nationwide are collecting these same types of artifacts as a way to reclaim their history and cultural heritage. These collectors believe that these items serve as important reminders of the struggles and triumphs of African Americans and should be preserved for future generations.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Breen will be forced to remove the reproductions or if he will continue to stand by his decision to display them."

9108001,464186,"Based on the news article, here are some key points about the opposition to Judge Thomas' nomination:

* The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.) has voted 50-1 to oppose Judge Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court.
* The N.A.A.C.P.'s decision was announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C., where leaders revealed that they had met with Judge Thomas to discuss his views on various subjects. However, an official said that Judge Thomas did not answer any of the ""hard questions"" posed by the group.
* The A.F.L-C.I.O. executive council has also voted to oppose Judge Thomas' nomination, calling it a ""disgraceful"" effort by President Bush to pack the Court with conservatives.
* The labor federation's decision was made after receiving a telephone call from N.A.A.C.P. officials informing them of the civil rights group's decision.
* The opposition to Judge Thomas is seen as an opportunity for opponents to reassemble the coalition that defeated Robert H. Bork's nomination four years ago.
* Administration reaction to the announcements includes disappointment but downplaying their importance, with the White House saying that Judge Thomas continues to enjoy diverse and growing support and predicting that he will be confirmed despite the opposition.

Overall, it appears that the opposition to Judge Thomas' nomination is significant and could potentially impact the Senate confirmation process."
9108003,464437,"This news article reports on the controversy surrounding the Milwaukee Police Department's handling of Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment and its impact on community relations. The article highlights several key points:

1. Two months before Dahmer's arrest, emergency operators and police officers responded to a disturbance at his apartment, but did not arrest him due to a dispute between two men.
2. The incident has sparked outrage and protests in the community, with many calling for fundamental changes within the department.
3. The Milwaukee Police Department has a history of being hostile towards minority members, both within and outside its ranks.
4. There are concerns that the police did not arrest Dahmer in May because they regarded a dispute between homosexuals as hardly worth the time to write a police report about.
5. Some community leaders are calling for a police liaison specifically for the gay community and improved training on dealing with homosexuals.
6. While there is support for the police, many are also criticizing their handling of the situation, citing a lack of responsiveness and harassment towards members of the gay community.

Overall, this article suggests that the controversy surrounding Dahmer's apartment has highlighted long-standing issues within the Milwaukee Police Department, including tensions between law enforcement and minority communities."

9108011,465908,"The article discusses the controversy surrounding Spike Lee's upcoming film about the life of Malcolm X. Amiri Baraka and other protesters claim that Lee will exploit and distort Malcolm X's history, and are urging him to reconsider making the film. They argue that Lee has a track record of perpetuating negative stereotypes and trivializing important issues in his previous films.

The protesters believe that any film about Malcolm X should be made with sensitivity and respect for his legacy, and that Lee is not the right person to make such a film. They point out that Lee has never been part of the struggles of inner-city blacks and has made films that perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Lee himself has responded to the criticism, saying that he will not bow to pressure from any groups and that he has a right to make the film as he sees fit. He also mentioned that he had previously criticized Norman Jewison's plans to make a film about Malcolm X, suggesting that he is more concerned with who makes the film than with the content of the film itself.

Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, has also weighed in on the controversy, saying that people who knew and respected her husband have a right to question anyone who is doing anything on his life. She emphasized the importance of understanding Malcolm X's message and legacy, and suggested that the film should focus on his life and times rather than trivializing or distorting it.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing debate about how to represent Malcolm X's life and legacy in popular culture, and the tensions between artistic freedom and social responsibility."

5. **Mayor's Response**: Mayor David N. Dinkins visited Crown Heights on Monday night and stayed for several hours, expressing concern about the violence and tension in the area.

This suggests that the protesters were holding signs or displaying their opposition to the situation through violent means.
2. 21: Praying - The article doesn't explicitly mention prayer, but it does mention that ""City officials spoke of danger for a city gripped by racial antagonism."" This could imply that some individuals may have been praying or seeking divine guidance during this tumultuous time.
3. 29: Vigiling (silent protest) holding placards, banners - Again, the article doesn't explicitly mention vigil, but it does describe the protests as ""young blacks gathered"" and ""pelt[ing] homes owned by Jews with rocks."" This suggests that some protesters may have been holding signs or displaying their opposition in a peaceful manner.
4. 56: Verbal Attack or Threat - The article mentions that ""blacks spoke of preferential treatment for the Hasidim"" and ""Jews spoke of blacks becoming criminals,"" which could be seen as verbal attacks or threats."

9108033,469008,"The article discusses the debate surrounding residency requirements for municipal employees, including teachers, police officers, and firefighters. Some argue that these requirements are justified because employees who live where they work have a greater stake in the community, while others contend that they can lead to alienation from the community.

In practice, residency requirements do not prevent police officers, firefighters, and teachers from living where they want. However, some union officials suggest pushing for an ""across the board"" statewide policy abolishing all residency requirements for uniformed employees, allowing any state resident to take a municipality's examination for firefighter, for example.

On the other hand, union officials representing clerical workers and laborers argue that residency requirements should not be eliminated but rather expanded and more strictly enforced. They believe that if non-uniformed municipal workers are required to be residents to keep their jobs, the same should apply to other city employees like teachers and public safety employees.

Some residents agree that their towns would be better served if employees had a greater stake in the community by being residents, but others disagree, citing concerns about work-life balance and personal well-being. Ultimately, the debate surrounding residency requirements for municipal employees highlights the complex issues at play in determining what is best for communities and their workers."

Thornburgh's campaign emphasized the positive, promising to fight for jobs, economic growth, good government, and stronger efforts to combat crime and violence in the streets. However, he also criticized his opponent as a ""60's liberal"" and a ""tax-and-spend Democrat."" Thornburgh has hired Roger Ailes as his media adviser, known for running tough campaigns.

Wofford, on the other hand, is trying to forge a reputation as a moderate candidate who can do battle on domestic issues that matter to Pennsylvania voters. He has sounded the charge of Democrat-as-crusading-outsider railing against more than a decade of Republican domination of the White House. Wofford's campaign manager, Paul Begala, said they will ""raise money and raise hell"" in their campaign.

The article also mentions the personal attacks that have started to emerge in the campaign. Thornburgh has referred to Carville as someone who has shown himself to be a ""pretty nasty guy over the years."" Wofford's campaign is preparing to turn the campaign personal and negative, with Chris Bravacos, the political director for the state Republican committee, saying he has already heard ""personal things"" about Thornburgh injected into the campaign.

9109018,472574,"A protest was sparked when Los Angeles police officers beat a motorist. The incident led to an investigation by the internal affairs unit, which found that a small group of officers were responsible for most complaints of excessive force. In response, the department implemented a program to address the issue.

The program included a special eight-hour class that used role-playing and other methods to help officers improve their communication skills. The first group of officers on the list was sent to this class in April.

One officer who went through the class was Jim Pott. He admitted that he had struggled with communicating effectively, but after taking the class, he reported that his marriage had improved significantly.

The program has been successful, with complaints against officers decreasing by 22 percent over the past year. The department is also working to change attitudes and reduce excessive force.

Experts have praised the Kansas City Police Department's efforts to address the issue of excessive force. Lawrence W. Sherman, president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington, called the department ""a model of preventative action to control police use of excessive force.""

Hubert Williams of the Police Foundation, a research group in Washington, said that Chief Bishop was ""on the right track"" by dismissing problem officers.

The incident also led to changes in police policy and procedures. For example, the department now checks complaint records every month to update the list of problematic officers, and commanders are notified anytime an officer has received three or more complaints in a six-month period.

Overall, the program appears to have had a positive impact on reducing excessive force and improving community relations with the police department."

9109022,473441,"The confirmation hearings for Judge Thomas, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee, have been intense and partisan. Despite some Democrats expressing frustration with his responses, Judge Thomas has not provided any new ammunition to oppose his confirmation.

Senator Hatch defended Judge Thomas, pointing out that he was asked about 70 questions on abortion during the hearings, similar to Judge Souter's experience in 1987. Hatch suggested that those questioning Judge Thomas should explain why he is being treated differently from Judge Souter, who was confirmed with a vote of 13-1.

The committee has scheduled witnesses to support and oppose the nomination next week. Senator Biden sought to explore Judge Thomas's earlier writings on natural law, which some saw as potentially leading to personal moral codes superseding the Constitution. Judge Thomas denied this, saying he would not use his personal views to decide cases.

Senator Kohl questioned Judge Thomas about his preparation for the hearings and whether he was coached to soften answers or avoid certain questions. Judge Thomas replied that he had not been coached and had prepared extensively on his own.

The hearing also saw some lighter moments, including Senator Brown reading the home furnishings section of The Washington Post during a particularly dry discussion of natural law, and Senator Danforth shouting ""No, no, no! Go right ahead with your questions"" after Judge Thomas signaled he wanted to take a break."

9109027,474075,"Based on the article, here are some key points extracted:

1. Liberty State Park was dedicated 18 years ago as ""America's gateway"" to the Statue of Liberty.
2. The park is now the focus of a bitter dispute between state environmental officials and local residents over a plan to renovate the historic Central Railroad of New Jersey terminal and construct an 18-hole golf course on 225 acres of the park.
3. State officials propose spending $5 million to renovate the terminal and ferry slips, allowing Circle Line-Statue of Liberty Ferry to use a ticket office in the terminal and dock its ferries behind it after reconstruction.
4. The plan also requires Circle Line to pay the state 5% of gross receipts from its New Jersey operations, estimated to generate up to $300,000 annually.
5. Many area residents and officials are opposed to the plan, calling it a ""desecration"" of ""hallowed ground"" and fearing that tourists will overwhelm the area.
6. The Liberty State Park Public Advisory Commission has requested a 90-day delay in signing the contract with Circle Line and moving its operation into the terminal building.
7. Hudson County Board of Freeholders has adopted a resolution opposing the contract between the state and Circle Line, and every Hudson County legislator has expressed opposition to the plan.
8. The state Department of Environmental Protection held a public hearing on the project, which drew nearly 500 people and over 70 speakers in opposition.
9. State Senator Robert Menendez (D-Union City) has spoken out against the plan, citing concerns about limited open space in Hudson County and the impact on residents who cannot afford luxury uses.

Overall, the article highlights a contentious issue surrounding the development of Liberty State Park, with state officials pushing for renovation and commercialization, while local residents and officials are concerned about preserving the park's character and minimizing the impact on the community."

9109060,474143,"The law that takes effect on January 1, 1993 requires Connecticut to find a solution for storing low-level nuclear waste within the state. The state has identified three potential sites in Ellington and East Windsor, but residents are protesting the proposal citing concerns about public health and safety.

Connecticut relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy needs, with 50% or more of its electrical grid coming from nuclear generation. As a result, it produces a significant amount of low-level nuclear waste that must be stored somewhere.

The state has sent mixed signals about what it wants to do between now and the cutoff date, with one hand pushing construction of a dump and the other supporting efforts to block it while seeking an alternative. The State Attorney General's office has said it will join a suit to overturn the Federal law if necessary.

Residents have been educating themselves on nuclear technology and organizing against the proposal. The town has also received $300,000 in state funding to help residents fight the proposal.

The Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service is proceeding with the site selection process, despite concerns about public health and safety. They are searching for an out-of-state partner to take Connecticut's waste, while also exploring alternative sites within the state.

Three states - South Carolina, Nevada, and Washington - that currently accept low-level nuclear waste have threatened to stop taking waste from Connecticut if efforts to build local dumps are not made in good faith.

The era of innocence about Connecticut's nuclear dependence is over, and this could have implications for the state's future energy policy."
9109031,474425,"This article discusses the retirement and disposal of missiles from military arsenals around the world. The trend is towards destruction or recycling of these weapons, rather than conversion into civil or commercial launchers.

The article highlights several efforts to dispose of missiles:

1. In Iraq, the United Nations Special Commission oversaw the destruction of Iraqi Scud missiles using a bulldozer with a steel bucket.
2. The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency is exploring new ways to remove solid fuel from metal casings, including using super-cold liquid nitrogen and high-pressure hot water.
3. The agency is also investigating the use of anaerobic microorganisms to digest some dilute components of rocket fuel.

The article also mentions concerns about the impact of a surge in small rockets on the commercial launching industry and the environment. Experts are divided on the extent of the danger to the ozone layer.

Some missiles, such as the aging Minuteman 2s, may be too unreliable for use as space launchers and will likely be destroyed or recycled instead.

Overall, the trend appears to be towards destruction or recycling of retired missiles, rather than conversion into civil or commercial launchers."

9109037,475390,"**Protest Information Extraction**

* **Event:** Grizzly bear hunt in Montana
* **Location:** Northern Rockies, specifically the high mountain country of Montana and surrounding wilderness areas
* **Date:** Ongoing, with an estimated 80 bears killed over the last decade
* **Protesting groups:**
	+ Swan View Coalition, a Montana conservation group
	+ United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), which estimates there were 440 grizzly bears in the northern Rockies in 1980, but has lowered this estimate to an undetermined number below that
* **Reasons for protest:** Conservationists argue that the hunt is not necessary for population management and may even be harming the species. They cite concerns about:
	+ Low bear population numbers (estimated below 440)
	+ Unnecessary killing of bears, including females and cubs
	+ Potential harm to the ecosystem due to reduced bear populations
	+ Lack of scientific justification for the hunt
* **Arguments against protest:**
	+ Montana state officials argue that the hunt helps keep grizzlies fearful of humans, which is beneficial for their long-term survival
	+ USFWS estimates that 21 bears can be killed by humans every year without causing a decline in the population
	+ Some biologists support the hunt as a sound biological approach to managing the grizzly bear population

**Key Quotes:**

* ""A good hunter does not want to be responsible for killing one of the last of an endangered species."" - Keith Hammer, plaintiff
* ""It's darn tough trying to count them. Look how much trouble the Census Bureau had counting people. But we think the bear numbers are stable to increasing."" - Galen Buterbaugh, Western regional director of USFWS
* ""In my opinion, the bear population is at an all-time low. Even if you used the Federal numbers, which I disagree with, they are barely sustaining this population of grizzlies."" - Keith Hammer, head of Swan View Coalition
* ""The point of this hunt is not to promote some unique hunting opportunity, but it is for biological management purposes."" - Marc Racicot, Montana Attorney General"

**Project:** Widening of Ratzer Road from Hamburg Turnpike to Route 23

**Location:** Passaic County, New Jersey, specifically in Wayne Township and surrounding areas

**Reasons for Protest:**

1. Concerns over traffic flow and safety
2. Loss of property rights (up to 40 property owners would have to give up eight feet of their land)
3. Destruction of natural environment (about 20 large maple trees would be removed)

**Protest Actions:**

1. Residents signed a petition opposing the project, with nearly 450 signatures presented to officials
2. Residents hired a lawyer, Charles Mysak, to represent their interests

**Key Events:**

1. County Freeholders voted to abandon the project in July after being confronted by angry citizens and confusing traffic counts
2. The resolution scrapping the project is contingent upon the county's being allowed to transfer $1.5 million in grant funds to other projects in Wayne Township
3. State Department of Transportation officials expressed skepticism about transferring the funds

**Notable Quotes:**

1. ""This kind of project is like a form of candy for politicians. The concerns of the citizens become secondary."" - Charles Mysak, lawyer hired by Ratzer Road Association
2. ""We've put off the inevitable... Within the next five years, like it or not, that road is going to have to be reconstructed."" - Richard DuHaime, Passaic County Freeholder"

1. Arcuri's condominium project in Dobbs Ferry, New York, has stalled due to market conditions.
2. City Federal Savings Bank, which provided the mortgage for the development, has gone into receivership and is now managed by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).
3. The RTC is working with Arcuri to resolve his debt, which totals $25.6 million.
4. In addition to his mortgage debt, Arcuri owes money to contractors who have not been paid.
5. The Village of Dobbs Ferry and the Town of Greenburgh are also owed significant sums in taxes and liens.

The article also mentions that a non-profit organization called the Trust for Public Land is working with Arcuri and the RTC to obtain land for public access to the waterfront area and potentially protect an archeological site."
9109044,475971,"This article discusses the ongoing struggle for gay rights in the United States, particularly in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Oregon, where campaigns have been launched to repeal laws protecting homosexual individuals. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) notes that it is a consistent theme in the civil rights of gay people that they must ""win twice,"" first convincing a legislature to protect their rights and then stopping efforts to repeal those protections.

The article highlights several key points:

1. More than 80 cities, the District of Columbia, and four states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin) now have gay rights laws.
2. In California, a bill has been approved that would bar job discrimination against homosexuals statewide, but Governor Pete Wilson has expressed opposition to the measure.
3. Some groups opposed to homosexual rights laws are adopting more aggressive legislative tactics, such as pushing for amendments to state constitutions that would prohibit the enactment of homosexual rights ordinances.
4. The battle over gay rights in St. Paul, Minnesota is particularly contentious, with a campaign to repeal an existing ordinance that protects gay individuals from discrimination.
5. Proponents of the law argue that it provides protections against job discrimination and helps ensure that gay individuals are not forced out of their homes or fired from their jobs due to their sexual orientation.

Some quotes from the article include:

* ""It's a consistent theme in the civil rights of gay people that we have to win twice. First we have to convince a legislature to protect our rights, then we have to stop the repeal efforts from overturning the legislative protection."" - William Rubenstein, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project
* ""In California small-business men see this as a nightmare. It creates a whole new area where employers can be sued by disgruntled employees. It's bad for business and it's not needed."" - Steve Sheldon, Traditional Values Coalition
* ""The right wing wants to keep us as busy as possible around the country putting out brush fires."" - Tim Drake, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
* ""I think if we repeal the ordinance, St. Paul will rejoin the American mainstream. Remember, it's only a relatively few cities and states with these kind of laws."" - Bob Fletcher, spokesman for Citizen's Alert
* ""Our job is not so much to change people's minds. Our job is to make sure our people come out and vote. The majority of our people are still in the closet. It certainly makes it more difficult to organize."" - Susan Kimberly, Campaign 90's

Overall, the article suggests that the struggle for gay rights is ongoing and that proponents of these laws will need to continue working hard to protect them from repeal efforts."

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (no specific mention of holding signs, but the article describes protests and demonstrations.)
* 44: Singing collectively (mentioned in the sentence ""City population figures show that the number of minority residents in Canarsie has grown steadily over the last decade..."")
* 97: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers such as a trial, filing brief, and so on (no specific mention of lawsuits, but the article mentions charges against Brian Fining and the investigation by the police bias unit.)"
9109049,476260,"The protest information extracted from this news article is:

* The city is seeking concessions from municipal unions that have been sought in vain for months.
* The Mayor and his aides are revising the city's four-year financial plan by mid-November, which may include layoffs and attrition of city jobs.
* The state takeover of the city's $2-billion-a-year Medicaid costs is being considered, which could happen faster than Governor Cuomo has suggested.

Additionally, the article mentions that:

* Municipal union leaders are not prepared to make concessions until they see a long-term plan from the city.
* Some senior Dinkins aides described Governor Cuomo's proposal for assuming the city's Medicaid costs as ""old wine in new bottles"" that might not be uncorked in time to benefit the political fortunes of either the Governor or the Mayor.

It appears that the main protests and demands are related to labor concessions, job cuts, and the takeover of Medicaid costs."
9109047,476262,"This news article reports on a lawsuit filed by the civil liberties union against Nassau County's Board of Supervisors, which has been criticized for being dominated by whites and lacking minority representation. The lawsuit challenges the county's weighted voting system, which was previously upheld in court but is now considered unconstitutional under a 1989 Supreme Court decision.

The Board of Supervisors has six members, with each member's vote weighted based on their jurisdiction's population and political power. This means that one member from Hempstead, the largest town, gets 30 votes, while another member from Glen Cove, the smallest city, gets only six votes.

Critics argue that this system is unfair and violates the principle of one person, one vote. They also point out that no minority has ever served on the board, despite minorities now making up 17% of the county's population.

The lawsuit aims to challenge the Board of Supervisors' system and bring about a more representative government in Nassau County. If successful, it could lead to a new form of government, such as a legislature with equally sized districts and equal voting powers.

The article highlights the political implications of the lawsuit, noting that it could shake up the county's power structure, which has long been dominated by Republicans. The Democratic Party is embracing the lawsuit as an opportunity to challenge the Republican machine and bring about change.

Overall, this lawsuit seeks to address issues of racial and ethnic representation in government and to promote a more equitable and democratic system in Nassau County."

9109050,476357,"This article reports on the issue of noise pollution caused by airplane traffic at John F. Kennedy International Airport and other nearby airports in New York and New Jersey. Residents living under the flight paths are experiencing significant disruptions to their daily lives, including sleep deprivation, increased blood pressure, and stress.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had planned to phase out older, noisier planes by 2000, but due to pressure from the White House and the airline industry, they have slowed down this process. This decision has upset over 800,000 residents who are most affected by noise pollution at Newark International, Kennedy, and La Guardia Airports.

Residents in communities such as Scotch Plains, New Jersey, and the Five Towns area of Nassau County, New York, are particularly vocal about their frustrations with the FAA's plan. They have been protesting for years, but their complaints often fall on deaf ears. Some residents have even taken to simulating aircraft noises over the phone or reporting noise abatement remedies that do not work.

The article highlights the emotional toll that airplane noise can take on residents, including increased stress and anxiety. Officials at the FAA's regional office and the Port Authority acknowledge that they are doing their best to address the issue, but residents remain frustrated with the lack of progress.

Residents are calling for new flight routes or alternative solutions to minimize the impact of airplane noise pollution on their communities. The article ends with a sense of hopelessness, as residents feel that no one is listening to their concerns and that the problem will continue to persist."
9109053,476495,"Based on this news article, I can extract the following protest information:

**Event:** Death of Yankel Rosenbaum in Kings County Hospital emergency room after being stabbed in a racial disturbance in Crown Heights.

**Protest**: About 3,000 Hasidic Jews marched through the community in what the organizers said was a demonstration for peace and security.

**Concerns:**

1. **Lack of qualifications**: The report by the State Health Department criticized the two residents who were working in the emergency room that night, including Dr. Pamela Damian, for failing to carry out a complete examination of Mr. Rosenbaum and for failing to monitor his condition properly.
2. **Supervision**: The report also accused the hospital of failing to supervise the residents properly, leading to a delay in detecting the third stab wound on Mr. Rosenbaum's chest.
3. **Lack of licensure**: Dr. Damian had not obtained a license to practice medicine in New York State, despite being a resident doctor for seven years and having completed only three years of her residency program at Stony Brook.

**Reactions:**

1. **Mayor Dinkins' review**: The Mayor ordered a review of the credentials and privileges of over 8,000 residents and staff doctors in the city hospital system.
2. **Doctors' union concern**: Dr. Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, expressed concern about low morale among doctors, which had led to departures from the program.

16 ; 28 ; 29 ; 31"
9109054,476795,"The article discusses how companies often dismiss key leaders in union organizing campaigns to deter further organizing efforts and intimidate workers. Labor experts say that this tactic is commonly used, citing examples such as:

* Domsey Trading, a Brooklyn company that dismissed 208 workers who were on strike since January 1990 after they approached the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) for help in their unionizing efforts.
* The Sae Gae Times, a Korean-language daily newspaper that fired 17 reporters and editors, including 15 who had signed union cards, claiming it was due to financial difficulties and automation.

The article also mentions how the ILGWU went to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to file charges against Domsey Trading and The Sae Gae Times for violating labor laws by discharging employees for engaging in union activity. In both cases, the NLRB has issued injunctions ordering the companies to rehire the dismissed workers while the board considers the cases.

The article highlights the challenges faced by unions when dealing with such tactics, as the process of resolving these disputes can take several years and may not result in a favorable outcome for the union. The unions must carefully consider their strategies and seek support from other organizations and the NLRB to achieve justice and protect workers' rights."

9109058,477216,"Here are some key points about withholding tax payments in Connecticut:

1. Some companies have not received forms yet and are ready to start withholding money regardless, using seat-of-the-pants estimates.
2. Self-employed residents and those with substantial investment income will have to estimate their own quarterly tax liability and make payments on October 15th.
3. The Department of Revenue Services has dropped the threat of civil penalties for withholding too little or other mistakes as long as officials believe that a taxpayer was not trying to defraud the state.
4. Many employers, including Xerox Corporation, have yet to receive forms and are planning to start withholding taxes based on their own calculations.
5. The new tax system is complicated, with multiple rates and credits affecting liability.
6. Some workers may not see the tax bite for weeks or months and could face a greater demand for a lump-sum payment next year.

Some notable quotes from the article:

* ""We're going to be off to a bumpy start,"" said A.J. Janschewitz, spokesman for the Department of Revenue Services.
* ""There just hasn't been enough time for it to be implemented smoothly.""
* ""It would be much wiser to pass a budget and leave it in place,"" said State Senator Gary Hale, who voted for the tax measure.

9110014,478237,"Based on the article, I code up to 4 protest activities:

16; 20; 27; 98

Here's my reasoning:

1. Meditation, ordinarily silent (16): There is no explicit mention of meditation in the article, but some of the quotes and descriptions suggest a sense of solemnity and gravity, which could be seen as a form of quiet reflection or protest.
2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20): The article mentions that black applicants were told they needed to go through a complicated application process, whereas white applicants were simply asked to write a check. This suggests that the club was using different standards for different groups, which could be seen as a form of protest or public demonstration.
3. Speechmaking, references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on (27): The article quotes Attorney General Robert Abrams speaking about the lawsuit and the club's practices, which could be seen as a form of public speaking or advocacy.
4. Other activity (98): I'm not sure what specific protest activities are mentioned in the article, but it seems to me that there may be some implicit forms of protest present, such as the undercover investigation by the attorney general or the experiences of the black women who worked with state investigators on the suit."

9110018,478484,"Here are the key points extracted from the news article:

**Protest Information:**

* The City is eliminating civil-service jobs to help resolve budget problems.
* A longstanding job-training contract with a nonprofit agency (Wildcat Service Corporation) hires welfare recipients, jail inmates on work release, and former inmates to do the same work as union painters.
* The union, Local 1969 of the Civil Service Painters, sued the city accusing Human Resources Administration of violating state law by replacing civil servants with welfare trainees.

**Key Issues:**

* Layoffs: Nine painters were originally scheduled for layoff, but the process was delayed due to paperwork issues. A total of 17 painters (40% of the 42 employed) have been laid off.
* Job Training Program: The program is in its fifth year and aims to teach basic painting skills as well as ""life skills"" like punctuality and job searching.
* Union Concerns:
	+ Labor leaders are alarmed at the possibility that welfare trainees could be used to replace civil servants.
	+ Trainees are doing the same work as union painters, including painting in city shelters.
	+ Unions argue that this is a form of ""cheap labor"" replacing family workers with low-paid workers.

**Financial Aspects:**

* Minimum wage for welfare recipients and ex-offenders is $4.25 an hour.
* The city paid $664,500 to Wildcat for the painting program in the previous fiscal year and has budgeted $398,000 (20% increase) for the first six months of the current fiscal year.

**Union Perspective:**

* Labor leaders support job training programs but are concerned about the replacement of civil-service workers.
* Unions argue that this is not just a job-training program but a way to get similar service at lower cost.
* Union officials note that welfare recipients and ex-offenders are exposed to hazards on work sites, for which they are ill prepared."

* Governor Lowell Weicker, who entered the crowd against the advice of his bodyguards and was met with hostility
* Senator John B. Larson (D-East Hartford), president pro tempore, who opposes the income tax
* Representative Robert F. Frankel (D-Stratford), majority leader, who supports the income tax

**Protest Tactics:**

9110016,478815,"This article reports on the trial of Soon Ja Du, a 49-year-old Korean woman who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Latasha Harlins, a black teenager. The incident has sparked tensions between Korean and black communities in Los Angeles, highlighting issues of poverty, discrimination, and economic competition.

The article notes that the killing has become a symbol of the problems faced by both communities, including economic inequality, racial stereotyping, and cultural insensitivity. It also mentions the rise of Korean-owned businesses in South Central Los Angeles, which have been targeted by black boycotts and vandalism.

The trial itself is marked by conflicting testimony from witnesses, with some describing a heated argument between Du and Harlins before the shooting, while others claim that Harlins was attempting to steal a bottle of juice. Outside the courtroom, community leaders are calling for greater understanding and cultural sensitivity, noting that Los Angeles has become a ""third-world city"" where different ethnic groups coexist but often clash.

The article also highlights the economic realities behind the tensions between Korean and black communities, including the decline of the black population in Los Angeles and the rise of Asian immigrants. It notes that some Korean business owners have been targeted by boycotts and vandalism, while others have been killed or wounded in holdups.

Overall, the article presents a complex and nuanced portrayal of the tensions between Korean and black communities in Los Angeles, highlighting the need for greater understanding, cultural sensitivity, and economic equality to address these issues."

* The controversy started when a 32-year-old graduate student at the Harvard School of Education, who was the top-ranked candidate, was reassigned as head of house at Lake House instead of being placed in another dorm.
* The decision to reassign her was made by President Nannerl O. Keohane and Dean Molly Campbell, citing concerns that some first-year students from backgrounds where homosexuality is still negatively viewed might feel uncomfortable having a lesbian head of house.
* An ad-hoc group of 35 students formed to respond to the controversy, proposing measures such as creating classes on homosexual culture, expanding resources for lesbian and bisexual students, and distributing educational pamphlets.
* President Keohane met with representatives from the group, who criticized both the switch and the explanation given by the administration.
* Some students, including Heidi Strader and Andra Zavoy, expressed discomfort or unease at the idea of having a lesbian head of house, while others, like Dorothee Harmon, disagreed with the rationale for the move.
* Irene Monroe, a lesbian head-of-house at Stone dormitory, cautioned that introducing newness to people can evoke fear and suggested that gradual exposure might be more effective.

9110035,479255,"The article discusses the challenges of implementing community policing in New York City, particularly within the police force itself. Commissioner Lee P. Brown has been advocating for community policing since his days as police chief in Houston and is now championing it in New York City. The approach involves assigning foot patrol officers to work with residents to resolve social problems that may contribute to crime.

The article highlights the skepticism among some police officers towards community policing, who view it as a departure from traditional law-enforcement methods. Some officers feel that the department is still too focused on arrests and summons, rather than building relationships with the community.

To promote community policing, Commissioner Brown has established a new award, Citizen of the Month, to recognize residents who work with police to tackle neighborhood problems. The article also mentions the launch of three police vans called Neighborhood Resource Centers, which will operate in different neighborhoods to provide access to resources and services that can improve the quality of life for community members.

The article provides examples of community policing in action, such as Officer Thomas Collins's response to a bridal shop crisis on Staten Island. He calmed angry customers and persuaded frightened employees to open the store for the brides-to-be. Commissioner Brown praised Officer Collins's actions as ""an act of compassion and initiative which epitomizes problem-solving policing.""

Overall, the article suggests that community policing requires not only changes in police policies and procedures but also a shift in culture within the department itself."

9110066,483375,"The article discusses the aftermath of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which sparked a national conversation about sexual politics and harassment in Washington D.C. The author notes that men and women on Capitol Hill are reassessing their professional relationships and joking nervously about harassment.

The article highlights the impact of the hearings on women's groups and female politicians. Women's groups have moved to exploit the simmering anger among women who watched 14 men on the Senate Judiciary Committee and 98 men in the full Senate decide a matter that stirred deep anger among many of them. Female political candidates report a flood of new interest and contributions to their causes.

The article also notes that the hearings have sparked a re-examination of America's mixed emotions about race, sex, and politics. Capitol Hill Women's Political Caucus has received 50 more signatures in just two weeks, indicating increased interest in promoting women's issues.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

The article states that the Chief used the motel rooms at a special rate, sometimes staying there with his granddaughter, and also used the swimming pool. He claims to have passed on information from these meetings to his aides, which led to arrests and drug busts.

However, Assistant Chief Esserman is quoted as saying that the operation had been of little value and should be shut down. An inquiry into the motel expenses was launched after a lawyer for the Police Department was shown some of the bills by a disaffected police major.

The article also discusses the Chief's approach to policing, which focuses on community policing and rechanneling the energy of those who might otherwise engage in criminal activity towards positive behavior. The Chief has stated that he believes that Yale University would be a better use of resources than imprisoning people for non-violent crimes.

The article presents mixed crime statistics, with some categories showing decreases and others showing increases. It also quotes various individuals, including the Chief himself, as well as defense lawyers and community members, on their opinions about his approach to policing."

9111021,486400,"This article discusses the protest movement that has been sparked by California Governor Pete Wilson's veto of a bill that would have protected homosexuals against job discrimination. The bill, known as Assembly Bill 101, was sponsored by Assemblyman Terry Friedman and would have prohibited job discrimination based on sexual orientation under the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act.

The article notes that six weeks after the veto, the gay-rights movement has been galvanized in a way that has not happened in years. The focus is shifting back to equal rights, and the issue has become a major political liability for Governor Wilson. Many experts believe that the veto was intended to protect Senator John Seymour, one of Governor Wilson's allies, against a challenge from Representative William Dannemayer, who is a conservative Republican.

The protests have taken many forms, including demonstrations, vandalism, and even a recall effort. The article notes that the anger and frustration among gay rights activists has been fueled by the perception that Governor Wilson has betrayed their trust and abandoned his earlier support for equal rights.

Some experts believe that the protests will ultimately backfire and damage the reputation of the gay rights movement. However, others argue that the issue is a major political liability for Governor Wilson and could ultimately harm his chances of re-election in 1996.

Overall, the article suggests that the veto has had a profound impact on California politics and has galvanized the gay rights movement in ways that have not been seen in years."

Explanation: 
1. Protest information extraction starts with identifying protest-related keywords in the news article. In this case, some relevant keywords are ""fare increase,"" ""protest,"" ""opposition,"" and ""groups."" These keywords can be used to extract specific information about the protests or opposition groups mentioned in the article.
2. The first mention of protest is in the phrase ""At Least a Dime on Jan. 1The Transit Authority had already warned that the current fare might rise at least 10 cents on Jan. 1, and possibly as much as 35 cents."" This implies that there may be some opposition or protests related to this potential fare increase.
3. Further down in the article, it is mentioned that ""Groups representing subway and bus riders also opposed the 25-cent fare increase."" This specifically mentions a group of protesters or opponents of the fare increase.
4. The last mention of protest is in the phrase ""In 1986, for example, the agencies were struggling to win support for a five-year, $8.6 billion capital plan for construction and improvement.

9111027,486636,"What a fascinating article! It appears to be about the controversy surrounding the proposed location of small shelters for the homeless in various neighborhoods across New York City.

The main opposition seems to be from middle-class residents who are concerned about the impact on their communities and property values. Some have expressed concerns about safety, crime, and the potential for the shelters to become magnets for problems like drug addiction and mental illness. Others have argued that the city should focus on renovating abandoned buildings in poorer neighborhoods rather than building new shelters.

It's interesting to note that some residents are also concerned about the racial implications of the plan, with some seeing it as an attempt by Mayor Dinkins to impose his will on predominantly white communities. However, others have expressed support for the idea of providing housing and services for the homeless, as long as it's not in their own neighborhood.

The article highlights the complexities of this issue and the varying perspectives of different community members. It also quotes city officials who argue that the shelters will be designed to provide supportive services like drug treatment and job training, and that they will be smaller and more discreet than previous emergency shelters.

Overall, it seems that there is a lot at stake in this controversy, including concerns about community character, property values, and social justice."

9111037,486980,"This article reports on the growing movement for gay rights in Queens, New York City, particularly in Jackson Heights, where Julio Rivera, a 25-year-old Hispanic man, was killed in a bias-motivated attack in 1990. The trial of the two men charged with his murder has galvanized the community and led to the formation of new gay rights groups.

The article highlights the significance of Julio's death and its impact on the gay community, particularly for Hispanic gay men who had previously been invisible or marginalized within the movement. It quotes Rafael Ruiz-Ayala, a member of Latino Gay Men of New York City, as saying that the trial has put a ""brown face"" to gayness in the city.

The article also reports on the rising trend of anti-gay violence and bias-related crimes in New York City, with 511 reported incidents in 1991 compared to 223 in 1989. Inspector William Wallace, commander of the bias unit, attributes the increase to the efforts by gay rights groups to promote reporting of bias crimes.

The article notes that Jackson Heights has a large concentration of gay residents, many of whom are working-class and older, and that the neighborhood is characterized by a more suburban lifestyle and lower rents. However, the community is also marked by a desire for privacy and a lack of connection to more radical movements like Queer Nation or Act Up.

The article highlights the role of Julio's death in galvanizing the movement, as well as the efforts of gay advocates like Alan Sack, who reached out to gay advocacy groups after Julio's murder. It also reports on the formation of new organizations, such as Queens Gays and Lesbians United, and the plans for sensitivity training for police officers and community patrols.

Overall, the article presents a picture of a growing movement for gay rights in Queens, driven by the need for greater social acceptance and protection from bias-motivated violence."

9111038,487815,"This is not a news article about a protest or social unrest. Instead, it appears to be a long-form journalistic piece that explores the lives and circumstances surrounding two young men involved in a tragic incident: Daniel Doyle, a college student from Jackson Heights, and Julio Rivera, a gay man who was brutally murdered by Mr. Doyle and his friends.

The article delves into the backgrounds of both men, highlighting their contrasting upbringings and personalities. Julio Rivera's life is portrayed as marked by insecurity and shame due to his lack of formal education and his sexual orientation, which was not accepted by his family or society at large. In contrast, Daniel Doyle grew up in a loving and supportive family environment, with parents who valued his education and encouraged his extracurricular pursuits.

The article also touches on the themes of identity, class, and sexuality, shedding light on the societal pressures that shaped these young men's lives. Julio Rivera's love for old classic movies, fine food, and wine, as well as his extravagant gestures, are seen as coping mechanisms to deal with the traumas he experienced in his life.

The incident itself is portrayed as a senseless act of violence, motivated by Mr. Doyle's desire to prove himself among his peers in the DMS gang. The article concludes by highlighting the devastating impact this tragedy has had on the lives of those who knew Julio Rivera and Daniel Doyle, serving as a reminder of the need for greater understanding, empathy, and acceptance of individuals from diverse backgrounds."

9111052,489302,"The article discusses a lawsuit filed by the Connecticut Association for Retarded Citizens against the state and four school districts, seeking to force the placement of mentally retarded children in regular classrooms. The association argues that this is the least restrictive environment for these children and would provide them with better opportunities for learning and socialization.

The state and school districts argue that each child's needs are different and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. They also claim that some children may learn better in separate settings, and that mainstreaming could deny them access to the best possible education.

The article quotes several experts and advocates, including David C. Shaw, a lawyer for the association, who says that fewer than 2% of mentally retarded children in Connecticut are currently in regular classrooms, indicating widespread discrimination. Dr. Jerome J. Spears, director of pupil and personnel services in Mansfield, which has successfully mainstreamed its mentally retarded students, notes that this approach can be beneficial for both the special needs students and their typically developing peers.

The article also touches on concerns about the cost and feasibility of mainstreaming, with some experts arguing that it may not be possible or desirable to integrate all mentally retarded children into regular classrooms. However, advocates like Stephen Becker, executive director of the Greater Hartford Association for Retarded Citizens, believe that with proper support and resources, many more special needs students could thrive in inclusive environments.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing debate about the best way to serve the educational and social needs of mentally retarded children, and the potential benefits and challenges of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms."

**Protest Event:** Cross burning in the Joneses' yard
**Date:** June 21 (no specific year mentioned)
**Location:** St. Paul, Minnesota
**Participants:** Robert A. Viktora and Arthur Miller 3d, both high school dropouts
**Background:** The two young men, along with four friends, gathered at Miller's house to discuss causing ""skinhead trouble"" and burning a cross on someone's lawn.
**Incident:** They formed a cross using chair parts, wrapped it in terrycloth, doused it with paint thinner, lit it, and ran back to Miller's house to hide.

**Legal Proceedings:**

* Robert A. Viktora was charged under the St. Paul hate-crime ordinance and with assault in the fourth degree.
* Arthur Miller 3d pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.
* Viktora challenged the St. Paul hate-crime law as unconstitutional, leading to a Supreme Court case.

**Key Quotes:**

* ""It's the Law That's on Trial"" - Edward J. Cleary, Viktora's lawyer
* ""Free speech is always going to offend somebody."" - Edward J. Cleary, Viktora's lawyer
* ""This ordinance is so broad that it opens the door to eviscerating the whole First Amendment."" - Edward J. Cleary, Viktora's lawyer

**Legal Analysis:**

* The St. Paul hate-crime law was ruled constitutional by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
* The court interpreted the law narrowly, stating that it should only apply to ""fighting words"" that inflict injury or tend to incite immediate violence.

**Community Reaction:**

* Russ and Laura Jones, whose yard was targeted, support the law, believing that having a cross burned in their yard is different from trespass.
* Steven Freeman, director of legal affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, concedes that the St. Paul ordinance could have been better drafted but believes hate-crime statutes have an important impact symbolically."
9112002,490701,"What an interesting article! It seems that the Anacostia River in Washington D.C. has been plagued by pollution and neglect, with some experts attributing the issue to a combination of factors such as slow currents, wetland draining, channelization of streams, and general disinterest due to its location in a predominantly black and poor neighborhood.

The article highlights the stark contrast between the Anacostia River and the Potomac River, which has received more attention and funding for cleanup efforts. The author notes that while $1 billion was spent on cleaning up the Potomac, virtually none of that money went to the Anacostia.

It's great to see individuals like Norris McDonald, director of the African American Environmentalist Association, working to raise awareness about the issue and encourage action. His approach is particularly noteworthy, as he seeks to connect the pollution in the Anacostia River to everyday issues affecting black residents in the area.

The article also mentions efforts by government agencies, non-profits, and community groups to address the problem, including a concerted response launched in 1987. It will be interesting to see how these efforts progress and whether the Anacostia River can become a ""fishable and swimmable"" waterway like President Lyndon B. Johnson once called for the Potomac.

Overall, this article highlights the importance of environmentalism and community engagement in addressing urban pollution issues. It also underscores the need for greater awareness and action to address the disproportionate impact of pollution on marginalized communities."

9112021,492490,"The article discusses the ongoing struggle for women's access to private clubs in the United States. Despite a series of Supreme Court decisions and state laws prohibiting discrimination, many all-male clubs continue to exclude women. The article highlights the slow progress made by some clubs, while others remain resistant to change.

Key points:

1. The 1988 Supreme Court ruling did not prohibit discrimination at large private clubs; it only upheld state and local laws barring such discrimination.
2. Few places have anti-discrimination laws, so most of the country allows private clubs to exclude women without consequences.
3. Many elite organizations, including the Bohemian Club in California, refuse to admit women or have admitted only a handful.
4. Advocates for women argue that the ongoing exclusion of women from private clubs perpetuates sex discrimination and undermines civic, business, and political activity.
5. Some club representatives acknowledge the slow progress but believe that little pressure has been exerted against them to change their policies.
6. Women who have joined clubs report feeling compelled to show they are not ""fire-breathing, bra-burning feminists"" and face psychological factors that discourage them from applying.

Quotes:

* Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women: ""This is not about women screaming to push into places where they're not wanted. It's about the ongoing exclusion of women from places where the civic, business and political activity of the community is carried on.""
* Lynn Hecht Schafran, lawyer with the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund: ""People who are aghast at the idea that women might be admitted to their clubs are not going to change their minds simply because we're nice people and we'll have tea with them.""

1. (20) Holding signs: The article mentions that many organizations pulled out after the Ku Klux Klan decided to enter a float, and more than half of the parade participants had already dropped out. While this is not an explicit mention of holding signs, it implies that there was some level of protest or disapproval of the Klan's participation.
2. (21) Praying: There is no direct mention of praying in the article, but the cancellation of the Christmas parade due to the Ku Klux Klan's involvement could be seen as a form of prayer or worship for those who feel that the parade has been desecrated by the Klan's presence.
3. (25) Selling buttons, bumper-stickers, books, frisbees: Although there is no explicit mention of selling merchandise in this article, it is possible that some groups may have chosen to sell items related to their opposition to the Ku Klux Klan's participation in the parade.

The article describes a neighborhood in Niagara Falls that was once abandoned due to chemical waste contamination from the Love Canal dump. The government had declared a health emergency and bought out most of the homeowners, but after a $100 million environmental study, state and federal officials deemed other areas near the canal ""habitable"" - although scientific constraints prevent them from declaring Love Canal safe to live in.

Now, about 25 families have joined the Alexises in the neighborhood, which has been renamed Black Creek Village. The new homeowners are a disparate group, varying widely in age, income, and background. They've refurbished their homes with new paint and effort, but it still feels like a ghost town due to the abandoned and decaying houses.

Despite concerns about the toxic waste, the residents reject criticism that they're taking unnecessary risks. They point out that there are unknowns everywhere, even in seemingly safe areas like New York City. Some original owners have not moved out, and while some who did move out seem to regret their decision, none have returned to their old neighborhood.

The article highlights the defiant love for the neighborhood among its current residents, who feel united against skepticism and hostility from outsiders. They're convinced that the Government would not allow people to return unless the area was safe, and they point to a 92-year-old neighbor who lived in the subdivision her entire life without apparent ill effects.

In contrast, environmental groups are appalled by the decision to resettle the area and have banded together in a series of suits to stop the resettlement. They fear that the revitalization could set a dangerous precedent for redeveloping less infamous dumps and contend that the studies failed to properly investigate questions about the long-term safety risk of living in the neighborhood.

The article presents both sides of the story, leaving readers to draw their own conclusions about the wisdom and risks involved in resettling a community contaminated by toxic waste."

2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing: The article mentions that half of the faculty members at the university have been on strike for nearly two years, which implies that they are holding signs and engaging in other forms of protest activity (code 20).
3. Sloganeering/chanting: The striking faculty members may be chanting slogans or participating in other forms of sloganeering (code 28).

9112036,493523,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding incinerators, which are facilities that burn waste to generate energy or reduce its volume. The article highlights the issue's impact on local communities, particularly in New York City, where the city's sanitation commissioner has announced plans to build new incinerators.

The opposition to incinerators is driven by concerns about their environmental and health impacts. Environmental groups argue that incinerators emit pollutants into the air, which can contribute to respiratory problems and increase the risk of cancer. Additionally, some critics argue that recycling programs are not being implemented effectively, making it difficult to reduce waste and rely on incineration as a last resort.

Despite these concerns, incinerators have become essential for managing waste in densely populated cities like New York City. The city produces over 20 million tons of waste annually, and traditional methods of disposal such as landfills are no longer feasible. Incinerators can reduce the volume of waste by up to 90% and generate electricity or heat from the combustion process.

The article also highlights the challenges faced by cities that rely heavily on incineration. For example, Seattle's recycling program is so successful that it creates a surplus of recyclable materials, which then must be transported to out-of-state landfills due to lack of capacity within the city.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of the controversy surrounding incinerators, highlighting both the challenges and concerns associated with them, as well as their potential benefits in managing waste effectively."

9112050,494927,"Based on the article, I would code the protest activities as follows:

1; 16; 20; 28

Explanation:

* 1: The article mentions that the town of Ramapo and the village of Airmont are being charged with discriminating against Orthodox Jews by preparing to adopt zoning restrictions intended to keep them out. This can be seen as a form of bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, etc.
* 16: The article also mentions that Chaim Friedman, an Orthodox rabbi in Airmont, was harassed and intimidated by neighbors and that a visitor's automobile was vandalized simply because he was trying to build a small synagogue next to his house. This can be seen as a form of meditation or silent protest, as Rabbi Friedman is not engaging in any loud or public forms of protest.
* 20: The article also mentions that Orthodox Jews are being excluded from living in certain areas due to zoning restrictions and harassment. Holding signs, picketing, or human bill-boarding can be seen as a form of protest against this exclusionary behavior.
* 28: The article also mentions the N.A.A.C.P.'s backing for the rights of Orthodox Jews to live where they want, and Bill Scott's quote that ""First it will be the Jews and then it will be the blacks."" This can be seen as a form of chanting or repeating slogans in support of the cause."
9112049,494957,"After reading the article, I have identified four protest activities:

1: 20 ; 2: 97 ; 3: 98 ; 4: 21

Here's how I arrived at these answers:

* 20 refers to holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing. This is evident in the testimony of Linda Sackman, a former model who shared her personal story of struggling with throat cancer due to smoking.
* 97 refers to lawsuits and other legal maneuvers such as filing briefs, etc. This is hinted at when lawyers for the Dinkins administration raise questions about whether the city has the legal authority to force the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accept public service advertisements.
* 98 refers to ""other activity"". In this case, it seems that some of the activities mentioned in the article do not fit neatly into one of the other categories. For example, the controversy surrounding cigarette advertising and smoking can be seen as a form of protest, but it's difficult to categorize specifically.
* 21 refers to praying. This is evident when Dr. Harold Freeman, a Harlem surgeon, says ""We should not be advertising poisons and things that promote death."" He seems to be expressing a moral or spiritual objection to cigarette advertising.

Please note that these answers are subjective and may vary depending on individual interpretation of the article."
9112051,495065,"The bogeyman is indeed a fitting description for Richard Gottlieb, a successful fund-raiser and key figure in the new coalition of groups opposing environmental regulations. His tactics, borrowed from the early days of the environmental movement, have been highly effective in raising funds and mobilizing support among loggers, ranchers, miners, oil drillers, dirt-bike riders, and others who feel threatened by big environmental groups.

Gottlieb's organization, the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, has raised millions of dollars on behalf of various groups fighting environmental regulations. His mailings have reached a growing audience of over 5 million people, making him a significant force in shaping public opinion on environmental issues.

The Alliance for America, which Gottlieb does not belong to but works closely with, has achieved some notable legislative victories, including the passage of a transportation bill that allocates funds for building trails on federal land for off-road motorized vehicles. The group has also successfully blocked efforts to raise grazing fees on federal land and increase environmental regulations.

Gottlieb's methods have been characterized as ""underhanded"" by his critics, who see him as a master of manipulation and misinformation. His partner, Ron Arnold, is equally provocative in his rhetoric, calling for the systematic cutting of all ancient forests and the opening up of national parks to logging and mining.

Despite the controversy surrounding Gottlieb and his allies, their movement has achieved significant traction, particularly among those who feel that environmental regulations are stifling their livelihoods and way of life. The debate over the proper balance between economic development and environmental protection will undoubtedly continue to be contentious in the years ahead."

9201059,503168,"The routine use of Native American names and symbols for things like automobiles and sports teams has been a long-standing issue. While some colleges have changed their team names, many professional sports franchises have refused to change theirs. The movement seeking changes in this area is not just about renaming athletic teams, but also about gaining respect and dignity for Native Americans as a whole.

The article highlights the controversy surrounding the Washington Redskins' name, with some arguing that it is derogatory and others defending its use. The team's owner, Jack Kent Cooke, has stated that he sees no reason to change the name, while Commissioner of the National Football League Paul Tagliabue has also expressed opposition to changing the name.

However, many Native Americans see the use of their names and symbols as a form of disrespect and cultural appropriation. They argue that these names and symbols are sacred and have historical significance, and that using them for entertainment purposes is harmful and offensive.

The article also mentions the National Congress of American Indians' decision to take a formal stand against the practice, with plans to set up an anti-defamation office to monitor abuses. This development has sparked outrage among some fans who feel that their traditions are being threatened.

9201062,503198,"The estimated rate of nitrogen pollution in Long Island Sound is as high as 50%. The construction industry is fearful that efforts to protect the water quality will destroy what little opportunity still exists for construction work in the shore communities. However, there are suggestions that the need to build new and upgraded sewage plants could form the basis of an alliance between labor and environmentalists.

The State Department of Environmental Conservation has banned expansion of four sewer districts in Westchester County that empty into Long Island Sound, as well as plans by the county to expand a sewer district in North Castle. The moratorium was lifted on January 17 when county officials submitted an alternative plan to limit pollution in the Sound.

The county's plan will limit fertilizers used on golf courses, construct new wetlands, and curtail boat discharges. Excess amounts of nitrogen are believed to be responsible for reduced oxygen levels in the Sound, causing large numbers of fish and shellfish to suffocate.

Trade-offs are necessary to accomplish the goal of no net increase in nitrogen flow, according to Cesare J. Manfredi, the water-pollution control engineer for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. The relationships between nitrogen flows, sewage plants, and development are complex.

The Long Island Sound Study is a six-year partnership of Federal, state, and local agencies aimed at identifying the most pressing environmental threats to the Sound and producing a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan to guide solutions.

Data from a $150,000 to $250,000 Federal grant will help monitor major tributaries that feed into Long Island Sound from Westchester County. The data will aid in periodic follow-up surveys of nitrogen levels.

The construction industry is concerned about the impact on jobs, while environmentalists are seeking to prevent development on lands bordering the waterway. There are critics who charge that the environmentalists' call for sewage-treatment plant upgrading and growth management is a barrier to labor's call for jobs and development.

However, David J. Miller, chairman of the Watershed Alliance, believes that labor and environmentalists are not on opposite sides of the spectrum of Long Island Sound issues. He sees a link between labor's call for jobs and development and the alliance's call for sewage-treatment plant upgrading and growth management.

The alliance will meet with construction industry leaders to discuss mutual goals. The goal is to develop a strong coalition between environmentalists and industry, which could lead to Federal financing to upgrade sewage-treatment plants and support both jobs and the environment."

**Protest Information:**

* The property rights movement is gaining strength across the country, fueled by cases like Mr. Valis's suit against the government for seizing his property.
* The movement aims to roll back the government's authority to enforce environmental laws, citing concerns over balanced environmental protections and the abuse of restrictions on land use.
* Conservative groups believe that environmentalism has replaced Communism as the No. 1 enemy and are driving the backlash against environmental regulations.
* The movement is gaining momentum with the joining of old wings of the Sagebrush Rebellion in the West (miners, loggers, ranchers, and energy companies) with private landowners in the East and South.
* Key leaders include Peggy Reigle, who bought an abandoned farm in Maryland only to discover it was declared a restricted wetland, and George T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society.
* The movement is gaining traction at all levels, from Congress to the courts, with conservative judges appointed by President Bush and his predecessor ruling in favor of property owners.

This can be coded under ""holding signs"" as they are expressing their discontent through this action.
* Activity 2: Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers (filing brief, etc.) - While there is no direct mention of lawsuits or legal actions in the article, it can be inferred that the trainers' protest is aimed at influencing the Florida Legislature to reconsider the proposed racing dates and intertrack betting money allocation. This type of political pressure is often exerted through legal means.
* Activities 3 and 4: None - The article does not mention any other specific protest activities beyond the initial action taken by the trainers, which was canceling the races at Gulfstream Park."

20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - Although there is no explicit mention of holding signs or banners, the article describes the marchers as ""marching"" and ""listening to criticism of the verdict"", which implies that they were holding signs or banners during their protest.

22: Procession or marching - The students marched about 18 miles from Teaneck to the Federal office building.

9204008,519654,"This article reports on the formation and activities of the Pink Angels, an unarmed group of homosexuals who patrol and protect their neighborhoods in cities with large LGBTQ+ populations. The group was formed in response to increasing anti-homosexual violence and frustration with the lack of support from city and police officials.

The article highlights the Pink Angels' efforts in Chicago's North Side, where they have been working closely with the police department's civil rights section to monitor hate crimes and report any suspicious activity. The group has about 50 members, including individuals from different sexualities and races, who patrol on weekends and stay in constant communication with dispatchers.

The article also mentions specific incidents that have motivated the Pink Angels' formation, including a shooting that was motivated by bias against homosexuals and an incident where a four-member patrol was confronted by up to 20 men armed with baseball bats. The group's leaders emphasize their commitment to protecting not just the LGBTQ+ community but also the entire neighborhood.

Overall, the article presents the Pink Angels as a proactive and inclusive movement that is working to create safer spaces for marginalized communities and to promote understanding and acceptance of sexual diversity."
9204010,520084,"What a powerful and disturbing article! It's clear that Cracker Barrel has implemented a discriminatory policy towards LGBTQ individuals, and it's appalling to see how they've handled the situation.

The quotes from George Frisbee, who was fired for being gay, are especially telling. He mentions that there's ""absolutely no legal recourse"" for him or others who have been discriminated against in this way. It's a stark reminder of the lack of federal protections for LGBTQ individuals.

It's also interesting to note how Cracker Barrel has handled investor concerns about their policy. Despite appeals from major investors like the pension funds of the City of New York, Dan W. Evins has refused to provide an unequivocal statement on the company's stance on discrimination.

The article also highlights the disconnect between Cracker Barrel's business growth and the public outcry over their discriminatory practices. While some customers may be sympathetic to the company's position, it's clear that many others are outraged by their treatment of LGBTQ individuals.

Overall, this article is a powerful reminder of the need for federal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation. It's time for change!"

9204030,523394,"This news article reports on a Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where justices are debating whether to apply a strict scrutiny standard or a lower rational basis test to evaluate state restrictions on abortion.

The key players in the case include:

1. Ms. Kolbert, who argued that the Court should continue to apply the strict scrutiny standard established in Roe v. Wade.
2. Justice Clarence Thomas, who did not ask any questions during the hearing.
3. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who asked Ms. Kolbert whether she planned to discuss specific provisions of the law and questioned the Solicitor General about the potential for a complete prohibition on abortion.

The article highlights the differing views among justices regarding the appropriate standard of review:

1. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that the Court could adopt a rational basis test, which would be a lower level of constitutional protection.
2. Justice David Souter asked the Solicitor General whether a complete prohibition on abortion with no exceptions for the life of the mother would be justified under a rational basis test.

The case is significant because it may change the standard of review for evaluating state restrictions on abortion, potentially impacting future cases. The Court's decision could also affect the outcome in other pending cases, such as the Guam law that was struck down by a federal appeals court last week."

Lessons Learned:

* Katherine Spillar, the Los Angeles-based national coordinator of the Feminist Majority, had instructed abortion-rights advocates on the lessons learned in other states.
* Operation Rescue did not shut down any abortion clinics in Buffalo despite hundreds of anti-abortion protesters willing to go to jail to make their point.

Defenses Held:

* The defenses coordinated by Katherine Spillar held, preventing Operation Rescue from shutting down any abortion clinics in Buffalo.
* The Pro-Choice Network, which had supplied escorts to Buffalo area clinics during four years of picketing, vowed to ignore the protests but eventually mobilized with thousands of volunteers and formed Buffalo United for Choice (B.U.C.).
* Training and tactics were developed by B.U.C., allowing them to effectively counter Operation Rescue's efforts.

Overall, the article suggests that Operation Rescue's Los Angeles office learned from their experiences in other states and adapted their strategies accordingly, while the abortion-rights supporters also learned from their previous experiences and developed effective defenses against Operation Rescue's protests."

King. The Korean-American community came under attack, with many shops and businesses being damaged or looted.

According to the article, many Koreans blame the black community for the violence, feeling that they are jealous of their success and hard work. Some Koreans also express frustration at the failure of the police to protect them and their property.

The article highlights the struggles faced by Korean-American business owners in the South-Central area of Los Angeles, who have become a lightning rod for resentment among some black residents. Many Korean-owned retail outlets have been damaged or destroyed, with some shopkeepers being forced to take up arms to defend themselves against looters and rioters.

The article also notes that many Koreans feel that they are being unfairly targeted by the violence and that their American dream is being destroyed. Some Koreans have spoken out about the need for greater understanding and dialogue between different ethnic groups in Los Angeles, while others have expressed frustration at the lack of police response to their calls for help.

9205044,527754,"Based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities into:

;27 ; 20 ; 25

Explanation:

1. Thomas Arthur Robb, the national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, gave a 45-minute speech to a crowd of about 300 people from the steps of the Limestone County Courthouse. This falls under category 27 (speechmaking).
2. The protest included holding signs and placarding, as the article mentions that Mayor Collins had revoked a parade permit due to unrest after the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist. This falls under category 20 (holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing).
3. The article also mentions that Mr. Robb was allowed to hold a news conference as long as it did not become a full demonstration that interfered with traffic. While this is not explicitly stated as an activity, it could be interpreted as category 25 (selling buttons, bumper-stickers, books, frisbees bearing demo info, and so on), as the goal was to disseminate information to the public.

1. Leafleting: The rally organizers distributed literature and placards to express their opposition to the Hasidic organization's application for Federal funds.

20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding: The crowd held signs and placards to demonstrate their disapproval of the grant application and to show unity among Hispanic residents.

28. Sloganeering/chanting: The rally attendees chanted slogans and phrases, such as ""the Hasidim want fire,"" to express their emotions and solidarity with each other.

98. Other activity: This category includes activities that don't fit neatly into the other categories. In this case, it might refer to the overall energy and passion of the crowd, which was palpable in the article."
9205048,529317,"This article discusses a protest march held on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. to draw attention to urban poverty and neglect. The march was led by several mayors from cities across the country, including Baltimore's Kurt Schmoke, who criticized Congress for prioritizing military spending over urban development.

The protesters carried signs that read ""Bail out neighborhoods, not banks"" and ""Health care for people, not profits,"" reflecting their frustration with government policies that benefit corporations and wealthy individuals while neglecting the needs of urban poor communities. Many participants were members of labor unions or nonprofit organizations involved in social causes, including helping the homeless and elderly.

Despite the efforts of organizers to draw a large crowd, only 35,000 people attended the march, which was significantly lower than the estimated 100,000 attendees predicted by organizers. The event did not attract significant attention from Republican officials, with White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissing the march as just another weekend protest.

The article highlights the frustration and anger felt by many urban residents who feel that their communities are being neglected in favor of military spending and corporate interests. Some protesters called for a re-allocation of government funds to support urban development and job creation, while others emphasized the need for increased investment in social programs to address issues such as homelessness and poverty.

The event was marked by impassioned speeches from politicians and community leaders, including Mayor David Dinkins of New York, who emphasized the need to address the root causes of urban unrest. Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat from Los Angeles, led chants calling for ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and ""no justice, no peace."""

* Janet Benshoof will head the new organization, which has already raised over $1 million.
* The new group will focus on reproductive freedom and expanding its reach beyond abortion rights.
* Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that the loss of the reproductive freedom project would not reduce the ACLU's commitment to abortion rights, but rather accelerate a change in tactics from litigation to legislation and public opinion.

As for specific U.S. activities:

* The new organization will open its headquarters in New York on June 15.
* Janet Benshoof mentioned that some conservative Republicans who support the right to abortion may contribute to the group's efforts.
* Clarke D. Forsythe, vice president and general counsel for Americans United for Life, criticized the move as ""radical"" and warned it would give the group a greater license to pursue an even more radical agenda.

9206008,534185,"What an inspiring story! It seems like the students of Putnam High School are taking proactive steps to overcome racism and promote understanding among different racial and cultural groups.

The formation of HEAL (Human Education Against Lies) is a great initiative that brings together 25 students who want to find solutions to racial tensions. Their plan to meet this summer, possibly with a picnic or other event, shows their commitment to bridging the gap between different groups.

It's also heartening to see students like Dean Hlavaz and Lisa Kenyon speaking out about the importance of getting to know each other and erasing fears. Their willingness to listen to others and learn from their experiences is crucial in breaking down barriers.

The town of Putnam itself seems to be adjusting to a changing racial climate, with more minority residents moving into the area. While this change can be challenging for some, it's encouraging that local leaders like Mayor Daniel S. Rovero are advocating for greater understanding and acceptance.

Of course, the threat of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) demonstration on May 9 added an extra layer of complexity to the situation. However, thanks to the efforts of students, teachers, and community members, the event was effectively countered, with no violence or unrest reported.

The focus now seems to be on building bridges and promoting racial harmony through initiatives like HEAL's retreat plans. It's wonderful to see young people taking charge and making a positive impact in their community.

Overall, this story is a testament to the power of education, community engagement, and intergenerational dialogue in breaking down racial barriers. Kudos to the students and staff at Putnam High School for their hard work and dedication to creating a more inclusive and harmonious environment!"

9206017,536094,"This article reports on a conflict between street preachers and the city of Beaufort, South Carolina, over a noise ordinance that prohibits loud and unseemly noise in public places. The preachers, who are mainly from rural areas, have been preaching loudly and passionately for years, but after the passage of the ordinance, they began to protest and resist its enforcement.

The article highlights the tensions between the preachers and the city's merchants and residents, who see the preachers' behavior as disruptive and harassing. The preachers, on the other hand, claim that their freedom of speech is being curtailed and that they are being targeted because of their rural, ""redneck"" backgrounds.

The article also mentions that some of the preachers have been arrested for violating the ordinance, with one preacher serving a 90-day sentence. The preachers' lawyer, Patrick Flynn, argues that the ordinance is overbroad and vague, and that it fails to objectively define what constitutes ""loud and unseemly"" noise.

The article suggests that the conflict between the preachers and the city reflects deeper social and cultural tensions in Beaufort, including class and racial divisions. The Rev. Karl Baker, a pastor who has been arrested for violating the ordinance, claims that the city is trying to bar the content of what they preach rather than how they preach it.

Overall, the article presents a complex and nuanced view of the conflict between the street preachers and the city of Beaufort, highlighting the tensions and divisions that exist within the community."

9206061,538384,"The article describes a controversy surrounding the planned burning of medical wastes at an incinerator facility located in Moss Point, Mississippi. The facility, which was built in 1985, has been upgraded to handle the burning of up to 50 tons of medical waste per day. However, opponents of the plan claim that it poses health risks to local residents, including children who attend schools nearby.

The article quotes several individuals, including Mike Vice, a Moss Point alderman, and Deirdre S. Janney, executive director of the Mississippi Civil Liberties Union, who characterize the plan as an example of ""environmental racism."" They argue that the predominantly African American community is being disproportionately affected by the pollution and health risks associated with the incinerator.

The article also mentions that two lawsuits have been filed to block the burning of medical wastes, one by Jackson County Physicians and Citizens for a Healthy Environment, and the other by the city of Moss Point. The Jackson County Board of Supervisors has agreed to join Moss Point's suit against the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.

Key points extracted from the article:

* Opponents claim that the incinerator poses health risks to local residents, including children who attend schools nearby.
* The facility is located near the Escatawpa River and within two-and-a-half miles of three public elementary schools, a junior high school, two church schools, and several day-care centers.

9206042,538544,"This article discusses a Supreme Court decision that ruled that smokers cannot sue cigarette companies for injuries caused by their smoking after January 1, 1966, when the first Federal law requiring warning labels on cigarette packages and advertising took effect.

The court found that the 1969 law, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, did have some pre-emptive effects, but only in cases where smokers were claiming that cigarette companies had a legal duty to provide more extensive warnings than required by Federal law. The court rejected claims that cigarette companies had a duty to warn about specific health risks.

However, the court allowed lawsuits that claimed cigarette companies concealed or lied about information they knew about smoking and health, as well as cases alleging conspiracy among tobacco manufacturers to misrepresent or conceal the truth about smoking and health.

The decision was seen as a mixed signal by some, with some experts saying it could lead to more lawsuits against the tobacco industry. The court's ruling on preemption was not unanimous, with three different opinions written by justices Stevens, Scalia, and Blackmun.

Some notable points from the article:

* Three Supreme Court justices (Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas) are smokers.
* The court's decision allowed some lawsuits against the tobacco industry to proceed.
* The decision was seen as a victory for the tobacco industry in some respects, but also opened up new avenues for litigation.
* The case, Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc., No. 90-1038, was initially argued last October and reargued after Justice Clarence Thomas joined the court."
9206041,538549,"This article reports on a significant Supreme Court decision, Lee v. Weisman, which upholds the constitutionality of school-sponsored prayer at graduation ceremonies. The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, holds that the government's involvement in religious activities does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as long as no official religion is established and no unwilling person is coerced into participating.

Justice Kennedy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual religious freedom and the need to guard against state-sponsored religious exercises that might compromise this principle. He argues that the Court's precedents, including Lemon v. Kurtzman, should be maintained to ensure that government does not establish a religion or coerce individuals into participating in religious activities.

The decision was seen as a significant victory for those who advocate for greater religious expression in public life. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the majority's approach would lead to a ""psycho-journey"" through the minds and emotions of adolescents, who could simply have sat through any prayer they disliked without suffering from coercive pressures.

The decision has implications for other cases involving church-state questions, including displays of religious symbols in public parks and the use of religious imagery on city seals. The Court may revisit its establishment clause precedents in these contexts, potentially leading to further clarification or expansion of the First Amendment's religion clauses."

**Event:** Supreme Court ruling on Hare Krishna movement's activities at airports
**Date:** Not specified (but likely 1992, given the mention of a Federal court decision two years prior)
**Location:** Airports in the United States
**Issue:** Ban on begging and distributing literature by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

**Ruling:**

* The Court upheld the ban on begging with a 6-3 vote, with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist writing the majority opinion.
* The Court declared unconstitutional the Port Authority's prohibition on distributing literature to the Hare Krishna movement with a 5-4 vote in an unsigned, one-paragraph opinion.

**Significance:**

* The decision opens the door to bans on begging at airports around the country.
* It may lead to further restrictions on free speech activities in public forums.
* Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's dissenting opinion highlights the importance of recognizing airports as public forums for speech activity.

**Key Quotes:**

* ""The tradition of airport activity does not demonstrate that airports have historically been made available for speech activity."" - Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
* ""One of the places left in our mobile society that is suitable for discourse is a metropolitan airport."" - Justice Anthony M. Kennedy"
9207001,539908,"The article discusses a settlement in a lawsuit filed by black and Hispanic families against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) alleging racial segregation in public housing projects. The settlement requires NYCHA to reserve 1,991 apartments for black or Hispanic families who were excluded from certain projects due to the city's selection policies. Additionally, the settlement provides financial assistance to 200 families who suffered discrimination since 1983.

The article also notes that this settlement could have a ripple effect in other cities, as it sends a strong message that public housing authorities cannot create white enclaves or steer minority applicants away from projects in white neighborhoods. The National Housing Law Project, which represents many tenants of public housing around the country, has similar cases pending in several states.

The evidence presented in the case showed that the Federal Housing Department knew about some of the city's racial practices and did nothing to correct them. The settlement requires NYCHA to overhaul its system for selecting tenants and provides a mechanism for enforcing the agreement.

This settlement is significant because it addresses the issue of racial segregation in public housing projects, which has been a long-standing problem. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that public housing policies are fair and equitable, and that all families have access to safe and affordable housing regardless of their race or ethnicity."

**Demand:** The protesters demanded more fiscal accountability and opposed the forced busing of students based on their parents' income.

**Reasons for Protest:** The protesters were frustrated with the school board's decision to implement a busing plan without considering the community's preferences. They believed that the plan would disrupt neighborhood schools and create unnecessary costs.

**Impact:** The recall election resulted in the defeat of four school board members who supported the busing plan. A rollback of the plan is expected, but some school officials warn that excessive changes could lead to further agitation in the community."

**Case:** William Andrews vs. State of Utah
**Crime:** Three counts of murder and robbery in 1974
**Sentence:** Death penalty upheld by the state court system despite 18 unsuccessful appeals
**Protest points:**

1. **Racism**: Civil rights advocates argue that Andrews received a harsher sentence due to his race, citing incidents like the note slipped to the jury box with the racial slur ""Hang the Niggers.""
2. **Jury composition**: The all-white jury was criticized for its lack of diversity and potential bias.
3. **Inadequate defense**: Andrews' defense lawyer had recently graduated from law school, which some saw as a factor in his unsuccessful appeals.
4. **Unfair treatment**: Supporters argue that Andrews did not intend to kill the victims and that the death penalty is disproportionate to his crimes.
5. **Legacy of distrust**: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' ban on black members has left a legacy of mistrust, which may have contributed to the racial tensions in the case.

1. William Andrews - Defendant facing execution
2. Stephen Hawkins (NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund) - Criticized the trial's handling of racism
3. Earl Dorius (former state's attorney) - Supported the death penalty and criticized Andrews' appeals

9208006,550656,"This news article reports on Ballot Measure 9 in Oregon, which aims to amend the state constitution to discourage homosexuality and other listed ""behaviors"" (pedophilia, sadism or masochism). The measure is backed by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a conservative group led by Lon Mabon. If passed, the measure could have far-reaching consequences for the rights of homosexuals in the state.

The article highlights several concerns about the measure, including:

1. Potential discrimination: The measure would allow landlords to evict gay tenants and employers to dismiss gay employees.
2. Censorship: The measure could lead to censorship of materials that promote or facilitate homosexuality.
3. Violation of free speech: The measure's language singles out homosexuals and those who support them, which could be seen as a violation of the First Amendment.
4. Hate crimes: The article suggests that the measure may contribute to attitudes of intolerance and hostility towards homosexuals, leading to an increase in hate crimes.

The article also notes that many political leaders, newspapers, and religious organizations have come out against Ballot Measure 9, including the Catholic Church. A campaign against the measure is underway, with support from gay-rights groups around the country and appearances by celebrities.

In conclusion, Ballot Measure 9 in Oregon poses significant concerns about discrimination, censorship, free speech, and hate crimes towards homosexuals."
9208007,551259,"The text describes a human rights report by Americas Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, which accuses the dominant forces in Miami's Cuban exile community of trying to silence opposing viewpoints with violence and intimidation. The report highlights several incidents of repression against those who favor a softening of policies toward Cuba, including raids on radio stations, beatings, bombings, vandalism, and death threats.

The report also criticizes the city government and law enforcement agencies for not doing enough to stop these attacks and for contributing to an atmosphere of intimidation. Specifically, it accuses Miami's Mayor Xavier Suarez of making statements that contribute to this climate and failing to take action against terrorist acts.

In response, the mayor and other leaders in the Cuban American community have threatened legal action against Americas Watch, claiming that the report is libelous and defamatory. However, the human rights group has stood by its findings and refused to retract the report or apologize for its contents.

The controversy highlights the tensions between different factions within the Cuban exile community and their approaches to policy toward Cuba, as well as the challenges of promoting human rights and free speech in a community where dissenting viewpoints are not always welcome."

9208011,552682,"A protest movement has emerged in support of Randy Weaver, who has vowed to die rather than surrender to authorities. The protest has been marked by violence, with gunfire erupting when Federal agents approached the cabin where Weaver is hiding. One agent was killed, and another was injured.

Weaver's supporters, many of whom are his neighbors, have been angry at the authorities for what they see as harassment and persecution. They have been vocal in their condemnation of the Government, with some calling it ""traitorous"" and others saying that Weaver is a ""patriot.""

The support for Weaver has been fueled by anti-government sentiment and racism. Some of his supporters have expressed racist views, such as the belief that blacks and whites should not live together. Others have blamed Jews for a ""new world order.""

Despite the violence and hostility surrounding the standoff, there are also efforts to defuse the situation and promote understanding. A human rights group has been working to counteract the negative image of Weaver and promote respect for the law.

The standoff has raised questions about the role of government in society and the importance of respecting the laws and judicial system. It has also highlighted the complex issues surrounding racism and anti-government sentiment in America.

Overall, the protest movement in support of Randy Weaver is a manifestation of deeper social and political tensions that are playing out on the national stage."

1. Bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, and so on: There is no direct evidence of bannering in this article.

20. Our research showed there were perhaps six arrests over a 10-year period and not much more than several dozen summonses issued each year: This refers to the frequency with which police officers issue summonses or make arrests for begging-related offenses, which is the main topic of this article.
27. Role of the Police: The article highlights the role of the police in enforcing laws related to begging, including issuing summonses and making arrests. The ruling itself also mentions the police's role in maintaining order on the streets.

9210006,560978,"This article discusses the struggle for power in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) between two candidates for the position of Superintendent: Mr. Thompson, who is the current Deputy Superintendent and the first choice to serve the remaining nine months of the previous superintendent's term, and Mr. Zacarias, a Hispanic educator who worked his way up through the school system.

The article highlights the intense divisions over this appointment, with some Hispanic leaders urging Hispanic parents to keep their children out of school if Mr. Zacarias does not win. Barbara Boudreaux, the only black member of the school board, calls such statements racist and argues that they are teaching students that certain groups cannot be Superintendent unless they belong to a specific ethnic group.

The article also mentions the growing Hispanic presence in Los Angeles county schools and the increasing political empowerment among Hispanic voters. It notes that Hispanic voter registration has risen significantly in California, with a projected 1.7 million registered voters by next month's elections.

The push for Mr. Zacarias is seen as part of this new sense of power among Hispanic voters, who are coming into competition with other minority groups such as blacks and Asian Americans. The article quotes various experts and officials on the significance of the multi-ethnic factor in governance and politics in big urban centers.

Some key points from the article:

* The LAUSD is a testing ground for the problems of the multi-ethnic American city of the future.
* The struggle over this appointment highlights the emerging politics of a city with a significant Hispanic population.
* Hispanic voter registration has risen significantly in California, with a projected 1.7 million registered voters by next month's elections.

9210018,561809,"**Winter Sports Programs Suspended Due to Funding Cuts**

The Chicago Board of Education has suspended winter sports programs, including basketball, unless $800,000 is restored to the city's sports and extracurricular budget. The decision was made by a group of principals who voted to suspend activities on January 29 if funding was not restored.

**Background**

School systems across the nation are struggling with shrinking budgets and refocused priorities, leading to athletic programs coming under fire. In Chicago, the principal's move was unprecedented in its severity but aimed to draw attention to the lack of funding from the state of Illinois.

**Immediate Response**

Within hours of the vote, Kimbrough's office was flooded with complaints and offers to raise money to salvage the upcoming basketball season. The resulting flood of financial support is expected to keep the sports program afloat temporarily, but the long-term picture remains unclear.

**Symbolic Action**

The principals' move is seen as symbolic, designed to call attention to the lack of funding from the state and gain support for a referendum item on the November 3 ballot. The item calls for an amendment to the Illinois Constitution requiring the state to pay more than half of the cost of public education.

**Impact on Athletes**

While coaches and players generally support the principals' action, concerns have been raised about better players potentially transferring or losing out on athletic scholarships due to the suspension of sports programs.

**New Power for Principals**

The events of the last two weeks have re-established Chicago's principals as a force in education, with some seeing this as a turning point in their role."
9210026,562629,"This news article reports on a protest march in New York City's Columbus Day parade, where Senator Al D'Amato (R-NY) and his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Mario Abrams, both participated. The article highlights the tension between the two candidates, particularly after Mr. Abrams called Senator D'Amato ""a fascist"" at a campaign stop the night before.

The main protest information extracted from this article is:

* Senator Al D'Amato marched in the Columbus Day parade to promote his re-election campaign and respond to Mr. Abrams's remark.
* The Senator was visibly upset by the ""fascist"" label, which he claimed was an attempt at ""beyond abhorrent stereotyping.""
* The controversy sparked a backlash against Mr. Abrams among Italian-American voters, with some predicting it would cost him support from this demographic group.
* Other political figures, including Ms. Ferraro and Ms. Holtzman, participated in the parade without incident, while Governor Cuomo emphasized the importance of celebrating the American experience rather than focusing on controversies surrounding Christopher Columbus.

Overall, the article suggests that the ""fascist"" remark was a significant flashpoint in the election campaign, highlighting the tensions between Senator D'Amato and Attorney General Abrams as they vied for support from Italian-American voters."
9210024,562646,"The article discusses the effects of Mississippi's 24-hour waiting period law on abortion services in the state, particularly for rural women who may not have access to travel to other states for the procedure.

Key points:

* The law has reduced the number of abortions performed in Mississippi by half, but many women are traveling to neighboring states to obtain the procedure.
* Proponents of the law argue that it allows women to pause and reconsider their decision to have an abortion, while opponents argue that it is an unnecessary impediment to medical care and increases the cost and stress on women seeking abortions.
* Anti-abortion activists have been using the waiting period to contact women at home and try to persuade them not to have an abortion, which some women find harassing.
* The law has also led to a increase in women traveling to other states to obtain abortions, which can be costly and time-consuming.
* Critics of the law are challenging it in court, arguing that it violates the Supreme Court's ruling in the Pennsylvania case that said state restrictions could not pose an undue burden on seeking an abortion.

Overall, the article suggests that the waiting period law has worsened the situation for women seeking abortions in Mississippi, rather than calming the debate as some proponents had hoped."

**Opponents:** Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and her administration

9211006,567261,"Here are some key points about the impact of Connecticut's recession on the tax issue:

* The economic slump has shifted public attention away from the tax issue, with many people now more concerned about their own financial well-being.
* Even among those who initially opposed the income tax, there is a growing acceptance of it as a necessary measure to balance the state budget and address fiscal concerns.
* The Democratic Party expects to retain control of both the House and Senate in the upcoming elections, partly due to Governor Bill Clinton's popularity and the perceived failure of Republican alternatives to the income tax.
* While some candidates still run on anti-tax platforms, others have dropped their opposition to the income tax and instead focus on cutting state spending as a way to reduce its burden on taxpayers.
* The anti-tax movement has splintered into different factions, with some advocating for immediate repeal, while others propose phasing out the tax over time or reducing it for middle-class families.

Overall, the recession seems to have tempered the public's enthusiasm for repealing the income tax, and many politicians are now framing their campaigns around themes of economic stability and fiscal responsibility rather than anti-tax fervor."

9211011,568834,"The article discusses the growing movement for sovereignty and self-determination among Native Hawaiians. It highlights the widespread agreement among Hawaii's political and business establishment that something must be done to address the historical injustices suffered by Native Hawaiians.

The article profiles various leaders in the movement, including Governor John D. Waihee III, who supports a solution that is inclusive of all ethnic groups; Mililani Trask, leader of Kalahui Hawaii, which seeks Federal recognition similar to Indian tribes; and Kawehi Kaunui Gill, who advocates for full independence.

The article also notes the divisions within the Native Hawaiian community, with some seeking complete independence and others advocating for a ""nation within a nation"" akin to the status accorded Indians. The movement is not without controversy, with some critics accusing its leaders of being unrealistic or even seditious.

Despite these challenges, the movement appears to be gaining momentum, with many Hawaiians finding their roots in the land, music, and culture. The article concludes by noting that the election of Bill Clinton as President has given the movement a boost, while also highlighting the ongoing resistance from the Bush Administration on the grounds that Native Hawaiians have had no self-governance since annexation.

Some key points extracted from the article include:

* The growing movement for sovereignty and self-determination among Native Hawaiians
* The historical injustices suffered by Native Hawaiians, including the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and the forced annexation by the United States in 1898
* The divisions within the Native Hawaiian community, with some seeking complete independence and others advocating for a ""nation within a nation""
* The ongoing resistance from the Bush Administration to the movement's demands for sovereignty and self-determination

9211024,572304,"What a fascinating article! It seems that there is a great deal of tension within the Black Studies department at City College, which has been exacerbated by the departure of Dr. Jeffries from his chairmanship role and the appointment of Dr. Gordon in his place.

It appears that Dr. Jeffries has a strong affinity for Afrocentric scholarship, whereas Dr. Gordon wants to broaden the scope of the department's research to include the experiences of Africans, African-Americans, and African-Caribbeans. This disagreement has led to fundamental philosophical differences within the department, causing morale to be at an all-time low.

The article highlights the challenges faced by both Dr. Jeffries and Dr. Gordon in navigating this complex situation. Dr. Jeffries is fighting to maintain his position as chairman, while Dr. Gordon is trying to bring about change and move the department forward.

It's interesting to note that some faculty members view Dr. Jeffries as a ""sacrificial lamb"" who has been unfairly targeted due to his outspoken views on certain issues. Meanwhile, others are concerned about the impact of Dr. Gordon's appointment on the department's future direction.

Overall, it seems that this controversy is not only affecting the individuals involved but also the larger community at City College and beyond."

* The goal is to raise self-esteem and encourage students to succeed in school.

**Controversy and Opposition**

* Some residents in the Warrendale neighborhood where the academy is located oppose the school, citing concerns about safety, property values, and racism.

**Academy Defenses**

* The academy's principal, Clifford Watson, defends the school's curriculum and goals, arguing that it is necessary to counteract the lack of representation of black people in traditional textbooks.

9212015,575168,"The article reports on a long-standing labor dispute between Local 6, a typographers' union, and New York's newspaper publishers. The dispute dates back to the 1962-63 strike, which resulted in lifetime job guarantees for union members. However, with the advent of automation, the union's power has waned, and it now faces significant challenges in maintaining its gains.

The article highlights how Local 6's president at the time, Bertram A. Powers, was prescient enough to recognize that technology would eventually make typographical jobs obsolete. As a result, he won concessions from publishers that they would not introduce technological change without union consent. This led to an agreement that gave publishers the right to automate their composing rooms slowly, in exchange for guarantees of lifetime employment for union members.

However, this concession came at a cost, as it allowed the news industry to modernize and the union's strength was gradually eroded. The article notes that Local 6 had fewer than 400 members left in the newspaper industry compared to its peak of 4,000 in 1962.

The current dispute centers around Mr. Zuckerman, who is expected to resume negotiations with the typographers after losing a court decision. However, most people involved believe that the union will end up with much less than job guarantees for remaining union members.

The article also touches on the history of labor relations in New York's newspaper industry, noting how Local 6 was once the dominant voice among the 10 newspaper unions. It highlights how Mr. Powers' success in the 1962 strike led to a decline in the power of the Newspaper Guild, which had previously been the pace-setter in talks with management.

Overall, the article portrays Local 6's struggle as a rear-guard action, highlighting the challenges faced by the union in maintaining its gains in the face of technological change and declining support from other unions."

**Event:** MLB Owners Vote on Labor Reopener and Lockout

**Date:** [Not specified]

**Summary:** The MLB owners voted to approve the labor reopener, with a bare majority, which allows them to reopen the current contract. This move is seen as a precursor to negotiations with the players' union, led by Donald Fehr.

**Key Players:**

1. **Ravitch**: A baseball official who worked hard to get the necessary majority and convinced some owners that the reopener and lockout were separate issues.
2. **Fehr**: The head of the players' union, who was not notified of the decision and sees the move as a potential trigger for confrontation.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Labor Reopener:** The owners voted to reopen the current contract, which allows them to negotiate changes with the players' union.
2. **Lockout:** A possibility that is seen as a last resort if negotiations fail.
3. **Salary Caps:** Ravitch proposed a system where players would receive a share of the clubs' revenue and that would place a cap on salaries.
4. **Revenue Sharing:** The owners who voted against the reopener also oppose extending their own revenue sharing plan.

**Quotes:**

1. **Ravitch**: ""I think the owners will stand behind me 100 percent as I try to achieve our bargaining objectives.""
2. **Fehr**: ""People he [Ravitch] allied with during the summer are people who would be viewed as hard-liners.""

**Background:**

The current labor contract expires in December 1993, and either side can reopen it by a certain date. The owners want to change the salary system to halt the escalation of salaries and have greater control over them. The players' union is concerned about the potential for confrontation.

**Timeline:**

1. **Late May-Early June:** Ravitch, Selig, Reinsdorf, and others tried to get Commissioner Fay Vincent to relinquish his authority in labor relations.
2. **December 31, 1993:** The current labor contract expires.

**Overall Assessment:**

The owners' decision to reopen the labor contract sets the stage for negotiations with the players' union. While Ravitch hopes to negotiate a new agreement without confrontation, Fehr sees the move as a potential trigger for conflict."

9301024,582901,"The 1992 Supreme Court ruling in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, No. 90-985, related to protests organized by Operation Rescue and similar groups outside abortion clinics. The court invoked the Ku Klux Klan Act (1871) to bar conspiracies that deprive any person or class of persons of equal protection under the law.

The ruling overturned a 1990 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which relied on the Ku Klux Klan Act to uphold an injunction blocking anti-abortion protesters from disrupting abortion clinics in the Washington area.

The majority opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia and held that the Ku Klux Klan Act does not apply to blockading abortion clinics. The court found that the demonstrators' motivation was not based on a class-based, discriminatory animus against women, but rather opposition to abortion itself.

However, the dissenting opinions of Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor argued that the Ku Klux Klan Act should be applied to conspiracies aimed at conduct that only members of the protected class (women) have the capacity to perform. They contended that the blockades were motivated by a desire to deny women the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to abortion.

The ruling also addressed other issues, including the applicability of a clause under the Ku Klux Klan Act that prevents conspiracies aimed at preventing or hindering law-enforcement officials from protecting equal rights. Justice Scalia's majority opinion held that this clause did not apply in the case because it had not been properly raised earlier.

This decision has significant implications for abortion clinics and anti-abortion protesters, as it establishes the limits of Federal jurisdiction to issue injunctions against blockading clinics. It also raises questions about the application of state laws against trespass, harassment, or interference with business to abortion clinics."

9301028,583274,"This article reports on a court ruling that halted the repeal of gay-rights laws in Denver, Aspen, and Boulder, Colorado, which had been approved by voters in November. The decision was seen as a victory for the LGBTQ+ community across the country.

The ruling came after four days of hearings in which lawyers argued that the law, known as Amendment 2, would breach the equal-protection guarantee in the Constitution. Judge Jeffrey Bayless of Denver District Court granted an injunction against the law, stating that there was a ""reasonable probability"" that it would be found unconstitutional.

Legal experts noted that the final ruling could shape new legal standards on the civil rights of homosexuals and potentially have implications for LGBTQ+ individuals nationwide.

The article also highlights the impact of the boycott on Colorado's tourism industry, with many groups canceling conventions in the state. Additionally, Hollywood celebrities have called for a boycott of Aspen, which has resulted in lost revenue for local businesses.

The Vatican responded quickly and negatively to Clinton's abortion orders, while American bishops are trying to maintain a relationship with the administration while disagreeing on abortion.

The article notes that Clinton's support for abortion rights did not prevent him from receiving 44% of the Catholic vote in the previous election, compared to Bush's 35%. Some prominent Catholic politicians, including Governor Mario Cuomo and Representative Henry Hyde, have publicly criticized the church's handling of the issue.

Despite these challenges, the church hierarchy remains committed to its anti-abortion stance. The United States Catholic Conference has distributed five million postcards urging Congress to vote against the proposed Freedom of Choice Act, which would prohibit states from enacting restrictions on abortion. The conference is also escalating its educational efforts to publicize alternatives to abortion for women in crisis pregnancies.

The article quotes various sources, including bishops and theologians, who emphasize the need for a renewed dialogue on the issue and highlight the importance of working together on other issues such as social and economic justice.

9302017,589631,"A protest has been reported at the Fort Worth jail in Texas, where inmates have complained about a Christian pod that houses up to 4,400 inmates charged with crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder. The protesters include a Jewish inmate who objected to the concept and a Methodist who claimed he was removed from the unit after his brand of Christianity did not mesh with the fundamentalist strain encouraged in the unit.

Civil liberties groups have joined their side, and now the matter may be headed for the Texas courts. One of the inmates, a Jewish prisoner, has filed a legal complaint against the jail, claiming that the Christian pod is a ""clear-cut violation"" of the First Amendment guarantees of the separation of church and state.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has also expressed concerns about the unit, saying it is ""exclusionary"" and a ""violation"" of the Constitution. The ACLU believes that the jail is segregating inmates based on their religion, which is unconstitutional.

On the other hand, Assistant District Attorney Van Thompson Jr. has defended the Christian pod, saying that residence in the cellblock is voluntary and that it simply accommodates inmates' right to free exercise of their religion.

The controversy surrounding the Christian pod has sparked a heated debate about religious freedom and the separation of church and state. Some officials have refused to allow journalists or lawyers to examine the cellblock, citing concerns about its constitutionality.

It remains to be seen whether the Texas courts will ultimately decide that the Christian pod is unconstitutional or not."

The passage of a state measure banning laws that specifically protect the civil rights of homosexuals has led to widespread protests and fears among the LGBTQ+ community.

Key points from the article:

1. Residents are worried about the growing influence of evangelical groups, which they believe is promoting a culture of intolerance and hostility towards those who do not share their beliefs.
2. The fundamentalist groups have been telling members how to exert their influence in areas such as public schools, federal legislation, and local politics.

4. Some schools have cut back on Halloween celebrations due to protests over the pagan origins of the holiday.

9303002,593541,"This article discusses the controversy surrounding the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York City, specifically the dispute between the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) and the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO). Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy ruled in favor of the AOH, allowing them to sponsor the parade without ILGO participation.

The article highlights the blurring of lines between winners and losers, as various groups and individuals took sides on the issue. Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had initially supported ILGO's inclusion in the parade, ultimately lost in court and faced criticism from both sides.

The AOH emerged victorious, but at a potential cost to their reputation and relevance. The group's stance against ILGO was seen as reactionary and alienated young people, potentially leading to long-term decline.

Meanwhile, Mayor Dinkins may have gained some support among gay voters, who are expected to increase their turnout in response to recent setbacks. However, this issue did not harm the Mayor's political standing, but rather served as a distraction from his re-election campaign.

The article concludes by noting that the controversy has created uncertainty and vitriol surrounding the parade, potentially dampening interest in the event. The AOH's Pyrrhic victory may ultimately hurt their efforts to attract new members and stay relevant in the city."

The club, which serves only non-alcoholic drinks, features topless dancers and has been accused of attracting unsavory outsiders and increasing congestion in the area.

Protesters have staged nightly demonstrations outside the club, chanting slogans like ""Close it now! Close it now!"" and heckling patrons and employees. Some merchants have also expressed concerns about the impact on local businesses and the neighborhood's overall image.

The controversy has sparked debate over the legality of nude dancing and the right to free speech. Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, argues that attempts to restrict such establishments are a form of censorship and a suppression of speech.

Some opponents have called for legislation to prohibit adult entertainment establishments from opening within 500 feet of residential areas, schools, or other adult businesses. Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey has drafted a bill to achieve this goal, which is expected to be introduced to the City Council.

The tribe is seeking recognition as an official Indian tribe and wants to reclaim land that was taken from them hundreds of years ago.

The article quotes several people affected by this situation, including Carol Moreau, who says she can no longer afford her mortgage and has been trying to sell her home but cannot because of the land claim. Another homeowner, Anthony Cerritelli, is worried about how he will be affected and whether there will be a statute of limitations on the claim.

The tribe's council chief, Aurelius H. Piper Jr., says that the tribe will not withdraw the land claim and will continue to file additional claims until a fair settlement is reached.

The initial president, Dr. John D. McGuire, aimed for racial parity among faculty and students, but this vision was not fully achieved due to conflicts over how to balance serving minority students with the college's role as a regional institution.

The article highlights the concerns of educators and administrators about preserving the integrity of bilingual programs while also addressing the needs of English-speaking students.

The article notes that Puerto Ricans are already American citizens, born into a centuries-old Spanish-speaking culture, and that many see holding on to two languages as vital for reconciling their dual identity. It also touches on the history of Puerto Rican migration to Hartford, driven by poverty and economic hardship on the island.

The article quotes various educators and advocates who emphasize the importance of bilingual education in preserving the cultural heritage and linguistic traditions of Puerto Rican students. They argue that integrating these students into predominantly English-speaking schools without proper support and resources could lead to a loss of culture and identity.

However, critics of bilingual education argue that its true value lies in teaching children their native language, rather than promoting academic achievement or social integration. They point out that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of bilingual education in achieving its stated goals.

The article also touches on the broader issue of desegregation and the need for education and outreach efforts to inform Puerto Rican parents about the benefits and challenges of integration. It notes that many Puerto Rican parents are skeptical about sending their children to predominantly English-speaking schools, and that there is a lack of understanding about what desegregation means.

9304003,599416,"The article reports on a housing discrimination case in Yonkers, New York, where 1,500 families were steered into a predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhood in violation of anti-discrimination laws. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and state, county, and local housing agencies have agreed to settle the case by establishing a privately run referral service that will seek apartments for these tenants in predominantly white towns and villages throughout Westchester County.

The consent decree requires that tenants be placed in apartment houses where more than 30% of the residents are not low-income black or Hispanic people. This means that black and Hispanic residents would be placed in apartment houses in predominantly white census tracts, such as Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Eastchester, Mamaroneck, White Plains, and other localities.

The agreement also bars officials from directing tenants to black neighborhoods or racially mixed areas where more than 30% of the population is minority. This threshold was chosen to prevent the phenomenon known as ""tipping,"" where a concentration of minorities prompts whites to move out.

The settlement is expected to have far-reaching implications, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of Section 8 recipients nationwide who may file similar suits. Housing experts warn that this program could create newly segregated housing patterns, with whites moving out and black or Hispanic tenants replacing them.

Some cautionary notes were raised about the potential for landlords to resist taking subsidized tenants, which could lead to litigation against them for discrimination or the county for not making enough low-income housing available. The screening process was also seen as a key factor in the program's success, as it would help alleviate fears among middle-class white residents that agencies would refer families with a history of crime, drug abuse, or residential turmoil.

The article quotes various stakeholders, including lawyers, housing experts, and tenants, highlighting their concerns and hopes for the settlement."
9304005,599472,"This article discusses the ongoing debate between environmentalists and the timber industry over logging operations in national forests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The dispute has been ongoing for almost two years, with courts ordering shutdowns to protect threatened wildlife such as the northern spotted owl.

The article highlights the intense efforts by both sides to influence public opinion and policymakers through various means, including:

1. Air tours: Environmental groups like Lighthawk have been flying influential people over clear-cut forests to show the devastating effects of logging.
2. Press conferences: Advocates from both sides hold press conferences to share their perspectives and statistics on job losses vs. environmental protection.
3. Social media campaigns: Hashtags and social media platforms are used to spread messages and rally support.

The article also mentions that President Clinton has been trying to balance the competing demands of jobs and environmental protection, as reflected in a recent public opinion poll. The poll found that 47% of Americans believe Mr. Clinton prioritizes protecting jobs, while 33% believe he prioritizes protecting the environment.

Overall, this article highlights the intense passion and advocacy surrounding this environmental issue, with both sides determined to shape public opinion and policy."

9304026,602724,"The article highlights the alliance between the Christian Coalition and the Catholic Archdiocese of New York in producing a voters guide for the school board elections on May 4th. The guide is intended to inform voters about candidates' positions on moral issues and is being distributed through over 200 parishes across Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx.

The alliance is not without precedent, as similar guides were distributed during presidential elections in Illinois and Texas, as well as a gay rights referendum in Florida. The Catholic Archdiocese's decision to distribute the guide is seen as a departure from its usual practice of not endorsing candidates or political parties.

The Christian Coalition, founded by Pat Robertson, has a history of involvement in anti-abortion work and has partnered with Catholics in similar efforts elsewhere in the country. The Rev. J. Terry Twerell, founder of the New York chapter of the Christian Coalition, stated that the alliance is not necessarily a long-term one and may depend on the reaction from the Catholic hierarchy.

The article notes that John Cardinal O'Connor has not publicly discussed the alliance, leaving the door open for an exit if the guide does not meet their standards. The distribution of the guide will be left to the discretion of local priests in parishes across the city.

The voters guide is based on candidates' reactions to a Christian Coalition questionnaire and will characterize their views on moral issues without making outright endorsements. The alliance highlights the growing influence of religious groups in political elections and the increasing cooperation between Catholics and Fundamentalist Protestants in these efforts."

9304033,603676,"This article reports on the case of Todd Mitchell, who was convicted of assault for participating in a racially motivated attack on Gregory Reddick in Wisconsin. The article highlights the constitutional implications of hate crime laws, particularly with regards to the First Amendment's protection of free speech.

The case revolves around whether the law punishing hate crimes for their motivation (bigotry) rather than their conduct (assault). The prosecution argues that the law does not punish thoughts, but rather discriminatory conduct. On the other hand, the defense claims that the law punishes thought, as it considers an individual's motives in committing a crime.

The article notes that scholars, civil libertarians, and state courts are divided on the issue. Some argue that hate crimes laws violate the First Amendment by punishing individuals for their thoughts, while others believe that such laws do not punish speech but rather discriminatory conduct.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court had previously thrown out the state's hate crime statute, ruling that it punished people for their thoughts and therefore violated the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment. The court noted that the law created a ""thought crime,"" which is prohibited by the Constitution.

The case is now being considered by the US Supreme Court, which will decide whether to uphold or strike down Wisconsin's hate crime statute. The Court's decision will have implications for other states with similar laws.

Some of the key arguments made in the case include:

* The prosecution argues that an individual has the right to think whatever they want, but not the right to direct attacks on others because of their race, religion, or ethnicity.
* The defense claims that the law is too vague and allows judges to punish individuals for their thoughts rather than their conduct.
* Some argue that hate crime laws are necessary to combat discrimination and promote social justice.

Overall, the case highlights the ongoing debate about the limits of free speech in the context of hate crimes and raises important questions about the balance between individual rights and societal norms."

**Location**: Various neighborhoods in New York City, including Chelsea in Manhattan, Marine Park in Brooklyn, Upper East Side of Manhattan, Forest Hills in Queens.

**Type of Protest**: Noisy picketing by residents and community groups to force sex-video stores, topless bars, and nude dance clubs to close down. Examples include a group of residents led by Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz protesting a nude dance club on Austin Street in Forest Hills until the owner agreed to sell his lease and move to another part of Queens.

**Reasons for Protest**: Concerns about the quality of life in residential neighborhoods, including increased congestion, litter, drugs, prostitution, and noise pollution. Some protesters argue that the sexually-oriented entertainment offered by these businesses has no place in residential areas.

**Reactions from Business Owners**: Sexually oriented business owners have criticized the protests and proposed legislation as thinly veiled attempts to censor expression. For example, Joseph Scalisi, owner of the Treasure Chest topless bar, claimed that complaints about attracting drugs and prostitutes were simply excuses for opposition on moral grounds.

**Proposed Legislation**: The New York City Council has introduced two bills aimed at restricting sex-video stores and topless bars/nude dance clubs to commercial or industrial areas. The bills would forbid these businesses from opening within 500 feet of a residential zone, house of worship, school, or another similar business."

1. The article reports on a ""Salute to Israel"" parade held in Manhattan, which drew an estimated 73,000 spectators.
2. There were no reported arrests during the event, but some protesters demonstrated against the exclusion of a gay synagogue from the parade.
3. The parade's sponsor, the American Zionist Youth Foundation, billed the event as an educational pageant to promote Jewish heritage and history.
4. Politicians, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, Governor Mario M. Cuomo, and several mayoral contenders, participated in the parade to court Jewish voters and demonstrate support for Israel.
5. The controversy surrounding the exclusion of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, a predominantly gay synagogue, from the parade highlights the political overtones of the event.
6. Some Jewish groups had objected to allowing the gay marchers into the parade, citing religious beliefs that sexual orientation was outside the traditional definition of Judaism.

9305009,608116,"Based on the article, I code the protest activities as follows:

< 20 ; 29; 28 ; 98>

Explanation:
1. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (Code 20): The Rainforest Action Network placed a full-page advertisement in The New York Times, which can be considered a form of holding signs or placards.
2. Vigiling silent protest holding placards, banners (Code 29): Although not explicitly mentioned, the advertisement can also be seen as a form of vigiling, where people are encouraged to hold placards and banners by sending telegrams to Mitsubishi and government officials.
3. Sloganeering/chanting chanting same small sets of words (Code 28): The advertisement provides a list of Mitsubishi products and urges people to send telegrams, which can be seen as sloganeering or chanting the same message repeatedly.

9305010,609572,"The article describes protests and prayer vigils outside abortion clinics in New York City, led by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue and Helpers of God's Precious Infants. The protesters try to dissuade women from going inside the clinics for abortions, and some have become increasingly aggressive and harassing towards clinic escorts and workers.

Proponents of abortion rights argue that these efforts are increasing because New York City has long been a stronghold of abortion rights and because events here quickly become national news. Abortion opponents claim they want to increase their presence in the city because of concerns about President Clinton's support for a woman's right to choose.

The article also mentions that abortion-rights advocates are seeking tougher laws at the federal, state, and city levels to protect the availability of services at all health centers. New York City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge has introduced legislation to impose criminal and civil penalties against those who block access to reproductive health service centers.

In response to the stepped-up efforts of anti-abortion counselors, abortion-rights proponents are also seeking greater police protection and legal recourse for clinic workers and escorts who face harassment and threats. The article notes that some women have received death threats and been subjected to physical intimidation by protesters.

The article concludes by noting that while both sides claim a right to protest, the confrontations outside the clinics can be intense and even violent, with some protesters using physical force to block access to the clinics or intimidate clinic workers and escorts."
9305015,610805,"This article reports on a labor strike by Mexican mushroom workers in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The strike began on April 1st and lasted for five weeks, involving around 140 workers who were employed by Kaolin Mushroom Farms.

The main grievances of the strikers included poor pay, meager benefits, and working conditions that they described as unsafe and unsanitary. Many of the workers had to urinate in the mushroom beds because toilets were too far away, leading to concerns about sanitation and health risks.

The strike was initially sparked by a dispute over wages, with the company imposing a new wage scale that the workers felt would reduce their pay and increase their workload. The workers, who had not had a raise in three years, argued that the new scale would lead to a wage reduction rather than an increase.

Despite the challenges faced by the strikers, they were able to gain some concessions from the company. Kaolin agreed to allow the workers to return to their jobs and did not stand in the way of a union election, which was held on Thursday.

The strike drew attention from local community leaders, including Quakers who called for ""healing"" in the community after the conflict had subsided. Some growers, however, disputed the criticisms of their operations, arguing that Mexican workers came to the area voluntarily and knew the struggles they faced when bringing their families with them.

In a paradoxical twist, some of the striking workers are concerned about the potential impact of a proposed free-trade agreement between the US and Mexico on the American mushroom industry. They fear that increased competition from Mexican growers could harm domestic producers and lead to further job losses.

Overall, this article highlights the struggles faced by migrant workers in the United States and their efforts to improve their working conditions and wages."

9305018,611371,"This article reports on a controversy surrounding graduation prayers at public schools in Virginia and other states. The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLF) has been encouraging students to include prayer and Bible verses in their graduation addresses, citing a 1992 court ruling that student-led prayers are constitutional.

One student, Jason Nauman, who is the president of his school's student council, has refused to give up on including a prayer and Bible verse in his own graduation address after school officials told him he couldn't. Nauman says it's an issue of free speech and that he would support Muslim students if they wanted to pray during a graduation ceremony.

The controversy has sparked protests across Virginia, with 2,200 students walking out of school last week to protest the Supreme Court ruling on prayer in schools. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also involved, arguing that the Supreme Court ruling is an unambiguous prohibition on prayer as part of public school ceremonies.

A survey by the ACLU found that most school officials plan to omit graduation prayers, although some officials are doing so reluctantly. The ACLU has threatened to seek injunctions against school systems in several states if they allow student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies.

One judge has ruled that allowing students to decide whether to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies is constitutional, but the ACLU says it will continue to challenge such practices. Some school officials have taken stands that may land them in court, while others are prepared to defend their decisions.

The controversy highlights the ongoing debate over religion and public schools in the United States."

9306001,612559,"The court rulings mentioned in this article have allowed some groups to deny or limit coverage for expensive diseases like AIDS. Specifically:

* The earlier court decisions ruled that self-insured employers were exempt from state regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.
* As a result, many employer health plans reduced or eliminated AIDS coverage, citing the need to protect their finances and avoid going bankrupt if they had to provide coverage for all employees with AIDS.

These court decisions have been challenged by people living with AIDS and advocates for patients' rights. Some notable cases include:

* Terrence P. Donaghey Jr.'s case against his union plan, which cut off benefits for people with AIDS nearly two years ago.
* Mark Kadinger's estate vs. the health plan of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 110, which refused to pay bills over $100,000 for AIDS-related cases.
* The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is suing the state insurance pool in Columbia, S.C., which excludes people with AIDS from coverage.

These challenges are seeking to apply the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 to ensure that people living with AIDS receive equal access to health care benefits.

9306003,612641,"What a fascinating and nuanced article! It's clear that the author has taken great care to portray the complexities of this mediator's role in a way that is both informative and engaging.

I must say, I'm particularly impressed by Ms. Gunn's ability to navigate the precarious position she finds herself in. As someone who looks like her customers but also has ties to the Korean community, she faces suspicion on both sides - from Koreans who think she can't understand their culture or isn't competent, and from blacks who believe she has sold out.

It's remarkable that she has been able to win over many of the skeptics, even in the face of adversity. Her ability to build relationships with Korean merchants and black customers alike is truly admirable. And her personal stake in the effort - having grown up and still living in a predominantly black and poor neighborhood - only adds to her determination.

The article does an excellent job of highlighting the cultural and class conflicts that underlie this conflict. It's clear that there are deep-seated issues at play here, from language barriers to cultural misunderstandings. And yet, Ms. Gunn's efforts suggest that it's possible for people on both sides to find common ground and work towards a more harmonious coexistence.

I must say, the moment when the Korean merchant learns a lesson about his customers is particularly poignant. It's as if he sees them not just as potential thieves or bad apples, but as human beings worthy of respect and dignity. That sort of epiphany can be life-changing!

Overall, I think this article does an excellent job of shedding light on the complexities of Ms. Gunn's role as a mediator. It's a powerful reminder that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, there is always hope for positive change."

9306015,614592,"**Protest Against Gay Ban in Military**

A significant protest occurred during Harvard University's commencement ceremony, where General Colin Powell received an honorary degree of law. Scores of students and faculty members turned their backs on the general as he accepted the award, demonstrating opposition to the military's ban on openly gay service members.

This protest was one of the most prominent displays of dissent against the gay ban in a debate dominated by the military and its Congressional supporters. The university's tight security measures were in place for General Powell's visit, with his introduction by Marshal Richard Hunt met with applause and cheers from the crowd of 35,000 students, faculty, relatives, and friends.

Many students expressed their disagreement with General Powell's stance on the gay ban, citing a desire to treat him with respect despite their differences. However, undergraduate students, including those carrying pink balloons distributed by a student gay rights group, showed less enthusiasm for the general.

The university president, Neil L. Rudenstine, has called for an end to the military's discriminatory practices against homosexuals. In response, some alumni who served in the armed forces disagreed with Harvard's choice of General Powell as commencement speaker, arguing that the military has more to fear from ""macho males"" than from gay individuals.

General Powell's speech touched on the homosexual issue briefly, emphasizing the need for a solution that balances individual rights with potential disruptions to morale and fighting readiness. He declined to provide details on the Pentagon's proposed plan to address President Clinton's pledge to end discrimination in the military based on sexual status.

Students who disagreed with General Powell's views expressed their disappointment with the university's decision to invite him, arguing that Harvard should not honor militarism or implicitly endorse the general's stance on gay rights."

**Legal Questions:** The Supreme Court ruled on narrow legal questions, including whether aliens on the high seas are entitled to refugee protection under US law or the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The court held that neither applied beyond US borders.

**Majority Opinion:** Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion, stating that the treaty and law were intended only to apply within the United States' territory and did not contemplate nations gathering fleeing refugees and returning them to their country of origin.

**Dissenting Opinion:** Justice Blackmun dissented, arguing that the 1980 law protected refugees regardless of their location, and that reading a territorial restriction into the law was contrary to Congress's intent.

* The Archdiocese cited a decline in Catholic population in the area, with some areas experiencing a 63% decline in Catholic population between 1970 and 1991.
* Parishioners have accused Cardinal Bevilacqua of ""willfully neglecting the poor"" by renovating a summer residence for himself and other clergy members.
* Some Catholics are upset about the consolidation of parishes and schools, feeling that their views have been ignored.

9307021,620013,"What an intriguing story!

So, we have a mysterious ad hoc volunteer organization that has emerged to defeat a measure aimed at controlling Medicaid spending on prescription drugs. The group's purpose is clear: to protect low-income people from being denied access to medicine crucial to their health.

The interesting part is that the drug industry has been instrumental in forming this coalition, with the help of a Washington lobbying firm called Apco Associates. The drug executive who inspired the coalition, Richard D. Stone, acknowledges that one reason for forming the group was the industry's belief that consumer advocates and minority members had more credibility on Capitol Hill than drug companies.

The coalition's organizing committee includes officials from various patient advocacy groups, as well as a Hispanic doctors' group in California and Rev. Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition. While some might see this as an example of the drug industry exploiting vulnerable groups for their own interests, the coalition members themselves insist they have not been exploited and that the cause is a good one.

It's fascinating to see how different interest groups can come together on an issue like formularies, which are designed to control costs by limiting access to certain prescription drugs. The debate centers around whether these formularies will lead to inferior health care for low-income individuals or actually save money in the long run.

As you mentioned, I'm trained to extract protest information from news articles, and this story is a great example of how different stakeholders can have overlapping interests and motivations that drive their actions."

16. Meditation (ordinarily silent, silent meditation service): Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, the concept of skinheads planning violent acts can be seen as a form of anti-meditation or silence, as they are choosing to engage in harmful actions instead of promoting peaceful coexistence.

20. Vigiling (silent protest holding placards, banners): This code is redundant with the previous one, as it also refers to silent protests and vigilance.

41. Surveys/Statistics (reporting on crimes committed by skinheads): The article provides statistics on the number of deaths caused by skinhead attacks since 1987, which can be seen as a form of reporting or surveying the impact of their violence."

* 1: The article mentions anti-abortion protesters, who may have been involved in some form of banner-hanging or displaying banners (category 1).
* 20: According to state law, fetuses up to 20 weeks are considered infectious medical waste and must be disposed of properly. This suggests that the protest was focused on the proper disposal of fetal remains, which could involve holding signs or placards (category 20).
* 26: The article mentions a ""prayer vigil"" led by John Cardinal O'Connor, which is a form of silent protest (category 26).
* 22: The article notes that the clinic has been a target of anti-abortion protesters and was firebombed in 1986. This suggests that there have been protests and marches (category 22) outside the clinic.

* The plaintiffs claim that the defendants' actions and inactions over the years have contributed to the problem of racial segregation in Yonkers, including the elimination of a fund to help school districts achieve racial balance and inadequate state aid.
* Some critics argue that administrative failures within the system are also partly to blame for the lack of progress in integrating the schools.

9308007,625783,"Based on the article, it appears that the riots were sparked by perceived racial inequities in the courts and the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King. The article highlights the sense of outrage and anger among many African Americans, particularly in South-Central Los Angeles, who feel that the justice system is biased against them.

The article also notes that there are differences between the two cases - the Federal case involving the police officers and the state case involving the defendants accused of beating Reginald O. Denny during the riots. While the police officers were acquitted in the state trial, they were convicted in the Federal trial of depriving Mr. King of his civil rights.

The article quotes legal experts who argue that the two cases are not mirror images, since the police officers were authorized by law to use force on an arrested suspect, as long as it was not excessive. However, Peter Arenella, a law professor at UCLA, notes that the legal distinctions may not make much difference to a community that accurately perceives the racism all around them.

The article also highlights the symbolism of the L.A. Four, the four young black men accused of beating Mr. Denny during the riots. Many see them as heroes and symbols of oppression, while others view them as perpetrators of violence.

Finally, the article notes that there is a sense of hopelessness and frustration among many in Los Angeles, particularly in South-Central, who feel that the justice system is biased against them. This sentiment is reflected in the quote from Michael Mason, a 21-year-old resident who has had brushes with the law: ""I don't see any difference between the L.A. Four and the L.A.P.D."""

The government's decision to proceed with the case has been met with opposition from Cuban-American groups and some lawyers, who argue that Mr. Cancio's actions were justified as a means of escaping persecution by the Cuban government.

The article suggests that there may be political motivations behind the prosecution of Mr. Cancio, particularly in light of recent attempts by the United States and Cuba to normalize relations. The decision to proceed with the case has been criticized as an attempt to undermine Mr. Castro's regime and punish a man who has become a hero to many Cuban-Americans.

The article also notes that some lawyers have questioned the legal basis for the prosecution, arguing that Mr. Cancio was acting within his authority as captain of the plane and did not violate international law. The case is seen by some as part of a larger political struggle between the United States and Cuba, with Mr. Cancio's fate serving as a test of the government's willingness to confront its own policies towards Cuba."

9308065,631730,"This article is about a trial related to the 1992 Los Angeles riots that occurred after the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King. The prosecution has called over a dozen witnesses who provided first-hand accounts of the violence, including Reginald O. Denny, who was severely beaten and suffered numerous facial and skull fractures.

The trial is seen as a test case for racial tensions in Los Angeles, with many black residents warning of renewed unrest if the defendants are convicted and receive harsh sentences. The prosecution has emphasized the heroism of African-American rescuers who came to the aid of riot victims, including four individuals who helped Mr. Denny get medical attention.

The defense argues that their clients have been scapegoated for the riots and face charges much harsher than those seen in the videos. None of the beating victims have positively identified either defendant as their attackers, so the prosecution's case relies heavily on the video evidence.

If convicted, the defendants could face life in prison, including attempted murder charges. The trial is expected to last two months, and the verdicts are likely to be highly anticipated and potentially volatile."

9309028,633362,"This news article reports on a court case in Richmond, Virginia, where a judge has ruled that a 2-year-old child should be taken from his lesbian mother and given custody to his grandmother. The mother, Sharon Bottoms, had been in a relationship with April Wade, but the grandmother, Kay Bottoms, argued that this was an unfit environment for the child.

The article highlights the controversy surrounding the case, with many arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent for the rights of lesbian and gay parents to raise their own children. The National Center for Lesbian Rights has expressed outrage at the decision, stating that it goes against established legal principles regarding parental rights.

The case was appealed, and the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) provided legal counsel to Sharon Bottoms. The ACLU executive director, Kent Willis, acknowledged that the case was ""a bit messy"" due to personal problems presented in court testimony, but remained confident about the eventual outcome, believing that as the case moves up the appellate level, emotional and extraneous matters will fall away, revealing the true legal issues.

Disparities among states are highlighted, with some courts consistently giving custody to heterosexual parents after divorce from a homosexual mate, while others have ruled that homosexuality is just one of many factors to be considered in a custody case. The article also mentions the issue of homosexual adoption, noting that courts in several states have ruled that homosexuals can adopt children.

The Richmond decision has been met with praise from some parental groups, particularly those with a conservative bent, who see it as a reinforcement of traditional norms and values. However, many others are outraged by the decision, which they believe sets a dangerous precedent for the rights of lesbian and gay parents to raise their own children."

9309046,635183,"This article reports on a growing movement among parents in New York City to keep their children out of school due to concerns about asbestos contamination and the lack of transparency from the city's Board of Education (BOE). The crisis began when it was discovered that the BOE's previous asbestos inspections were flawed, leading to many schools being closed or having to undergo costly renovations.

The article highlights several examples of parents' defiance, including:

1. Teachers at one school in the Bronx have vowed not to teach on Monday morning unless they are assured that it is safe.
2. Parents in District 30 in Queens have shut down their schools until they receive written assurances that the schools are safe.
3. In another district, parents are planning a boycott of schools that will be opening with double or shortened sessions.

The article also quotes several parents and school officials who express frustration and anger at the BOE's handling of the crisis. Many feel that the city has not been transparent about the asbestos contamination and the plans to address it, leading to feelings of mistrust and fear for their children's safety.

Overall, this article suggests that the crisis is having a significant impact on the city's education system and its families, with many feeling forced to take drastic action to protect their children."

The article mentions Susan Kenney's group, Gun Responsibility in Every Family (GRIEF), which has persuaded legislatures to pass laws making an adult liable in a shooting involving injury or death when a loaded gun was left where it was easily accessible to anyone age 16 and under.
* 28: Vigiling, silent protest holding placards, banners. The article mentions Susan Kenney's vow that her son David's death would not be in vain, implying that she is engaging in a silent vigil or protest of some kind to bring attention to the issue of gun responsibility.
* 46: Meeting candidates. Although this activity is not explicitly mentioned in the article, it can be inferred that Susan Kenney and her group are meeting with lawmakers to advocate for changes to gun laws.
* 52: Sit-ins. The article mentions an example of a fatal shooting in Connecticut that could be the first to go to trial under the new law approved by the General Assembly in 1991. This could be seen as a form of sit-in or protest, where individuals are occupying a space (in this case, a courtroom) to bring attention to the issue."

9309061,636426,"This news article discusses a case involving an anencephalic baby, born without a brain, who has been receiving medical treatment despite being declared ""brain dead"" by medical professionals. The mother is refusing to give up on her child's life, citing her Christian faith and desire to protect all life.

The article highlights the ethical debate surrounding this case, with some experts arguing that it is inappropriate to continue treating a baby without a brain, while others believe that the mother has the right to decide what is best for her child. The case has sparked discussion about patient autonomy and the ""right to die,"" with some arguing that continuing treatment for an anencephalic baby goes against medical ethics.

The article notes that many details of the case have been kept secret under a protective order issued by the court, but it has galvanized medical ethics experts around the country. The mother's decision to continue treatment has been supported by Judge Hilton, who ruled that the hospital would be violating federal laws and the mother's constitutional right if they refused to treat the baby's next respiratory crisis.

The article quotes various medical ethics experts on the case, including Dr. Michael Grodin, who argues that sustaining the life of an anencephalic baby is ""the ultimate inappropriate use of health care resources."" On the other hand, Dr. Robert M. Veatch testifies for the mother, stating that the decision to continue treatment is well within the range of parental discretion.

9309062,636439,"This article discusses the mobilization of citizens in response to President Clinton's speech on healthcare reform. The article highlights how special interest groups are using various tactics, including grass-roots lobbying, advertising campaigns, and even scripted palm cards, to influence lawmakers and shape public opinion.

The article notes that the healthcare industry is large and affects virtually every American, leading to a diverse range of interest groups emerging to advocate for their concerns. These groups include pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and small business owners, among others.

Some notable examples of grassroots lobbying mentioned in the article include:

* Hundreds of R.J. Reynolds employees volunteering to travel to Washington to lobby against higher cigarette taxes.
* AIDS activists staging street theaters to raise awareness about healthcare reform.
* Doctors raising concerns with patients during physical examinations.
* Members of Congress saying they don't have time to schedule all the face-to-face meetings requested from various interest groups.

The article also highlights the role of artificial stimulation in mobilizing citizens, citing examples such as pharmaceutical companies writing to shareholders warning of potential losses and Planned Parenthood encouraging its members to send postcards demanding coverage for certain services.

Despite this grassroots activism, major interest groups like the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians are still spending millions on hiring lobbyists. Political action committees linked to these groups have also increased their campaign contributions to lawmakers in an effort to increase their access and influence.

Additionally, Giacobbe is distributing chocolate chips made to look like gambling chips, which is code 15 (distributing materials).

He is also openly publicizing his intention to offer gambling at his restaurant, which is code 20 (publicly protesting or demonstrating).

Explanation:

* 1: Bannering or hanging banners on buildings (the newspaper's logo is displayed on the placards with slogans like ""No Justice, No Post,"" ""Et Tu, Rupert,"" and ""Murdoch Inc."")
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (workers from The New York Post are pounding the pavement, holding pickets in hand)
* 41: Polling report of polling attitudes regarding social movement claim (the article mentions that employees feel jerked around and are skeptical about Murdoch's position)
* 98: Other activity (the article does not fit into any specific category beyond those listed)"
9310006,637990,"It seems unlikely that the New York Newspaper Guild can recover its credibility as a force in the industry given its current situation. The guild's strike against Murdoch has been unsuccessful, and many of its members are already considering returning to work without a contract. Additionally, Murdoch has begun requiring strikers to reapply for their jobs, which could lead to further erosion of the guild's power.

The guild leaders' meeting with Cardinal O'Connor and their acknowledgment that they have limited options suggests that they may be facing significant challenges in rebuilding the union's strength. The fact that some guild members have already returned to work without a contract also suggests that morale is low and that many workers may be willing to accept less favorable terms or even individual agreements rather than continuing the strike.

It appears that Murdoch has successfully exploited the guild's lack of a contract, which gives him the legal power to treat current employees as if they had never worked at the newspaper. This could lead to a significant weakening of the union's bargaining position and potentially pave the way for further concessions or even the loss of jobs.

Overall, it seems that the rift between the guild and Murdoch is likely to be difficult to repair, and the guild's credibility may continue to suffer as a result."
9310004,637995,"This article discusses the growing movement of Mormon women seeking greater equality and leadership roles within the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints (LDS). The LDS church has a patriarchal structure, with men holding most positions of authority. While women can deliver sermons and lead prayers, they are not allowed to baptize, bless, or distribute sacraments, nor do they have access to other positions of leadership.

The article highlights the story of Lynn Kanavel Whitesides, president of the Mormon Women's Forum, who was disciplined by church authorities for her advocacy on behalf of women's rights. She and five others were punished for their actions, with some being excommunicated from the church.

The debate over feminism in the LDS Church is not new, but it has gained momentum in recent years as more women become educated and seek greater involvement in the church. The article notes that a long-established doctrine of Mormonism holds that there is a female deity, which some women have begun to pray to, citing this belief as logical grounds for opening leadership roles to women.

The article also touches on the changing profile of LDS members, with statistics showing that family size, working women, and divorce rates are becoming more aligned with national averages. This shift has led some to argue that the church's traditional emphasis on large families and homemaking is no longer relevant or economically possible for many families.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of the tensions between tradition and modernity within the LDS Church, highlighting the struggles faced by women seeking greater equality and leadership roles within the institution."

9310010,638154,"The protest was organized by the Southside Fair Housing Committee and Brooklyn Legal Services to bring attention to the alleged unfair treatment of Hispanic residents in the Williamsburg public housing project. The protesters occupied four buildings on Friday evening and remained there for 24 hours before leaving.

The main concern was that Hasidic Jews would receive preferential treatment in the assignment of apartments, a claim denied by City Housing Authority Chairman Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero. The protesters were particularly upset about the planned combination of waiting lists for new tenants and those seeking to transfer from overcrowded apartments, which they believed would continue to favor the Jewish community.

The protest was successful in bringing attention to the issue and prompting discussions with public officials. Representative Nydia M. Velasquez addressed the crowd, emphasizing that the Housing Authority must understand that this represents frustration over neglect and discrimination in housing. The protesters left the buildings after a meeting with public officials and assurances that the process would be fair.

The protest was part of a long-standing issue regarding discriminatory housing policies in Williamsburg. In 1991, a settlement was reached to increase the percentage of black and Hispanic tenants in the neighborhood's three other projects. However, concerns remain about the fairness of the assignment process and the need for continued advocacy.

Key figures involved in the protest include:

* Mauricio Hernandez Arroyo, lawyer for Brooklyn Legal Services
* Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, chairman of the City Housing Authority
* Luis Garden-Acosta, director of El Puente community development organization
* Norma Alvarez, 24-year-old mother who participated in the protest

The protest was marked by a sense of unity and solidarity among Hispanic residents, with chants and gestures celebrating their shared experience. The Hasidic Jewish community also had representatives present, although they did not actively participate in the protest."
9310011,638759,"This article is about the trial of individuals accused of perpetrating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The prosecution is presenting evidence and witnesses to prove that the defendants were involved in renting a van that carried the bomb, while the defense is arguing that the government's case relies on circumstantial evidence and that their clients are innocent.

The article describes the opening statements made by the prosecutor, J. Gilmore Childers, who painted a vivid picture of the destruction and chaos caused by the bombing. He also presented the first witness, Charles J. Maikish, director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's world trade department, who described the events of the day of the bombing and broke down in tears as he recalled seeing a young girl with her face cut.

The defense lawyers did not try to diminish the impact of the disaster, but instead focused on attacking the government's case. They argued that the prosecution's evidence was circumstantial and that their clients were innocent until proven guilty. The defense also pointed out inconsistencies in the government's timeline and attempted to poke holes in the evidence presented.

The article quotes one of the defense lawyers, Austin V. Campriello, as saying that the bombing was a ""tragic, terrible event"" that affected everyone, including the defendants. He argued that the government is trying to make the tragedy their own and that the jury should not be swayed by emotional appeals.

Overall, the article suggests that the trial will be a complex and contentious one, with both sides presenting evidence and arguing their cases in an attempt to prove guilt or innocence."

**Complaints:**

* Being mistreated by her superiors
* Harassment and assault by a supervisor during an undercover assignment in Arizona in December 1988

**Actions taken:**

* Filed a complaint with the FBI
* Testified at a Congressional hearing early this year
* Detailed her accusations in a suit filed in Federal District Court in Arizona, accusing the FBI of harassment. No trial date has been set for the suit.

**Impact:**

* Ms. Doucette was denied entrance to management programs and told to improve her relations with her male co-workers.
* The case highlights the ongoing issue of sex discrimination at the FBI, which has a history of being resistant to hiring women as agents until after J. Edgar Hoover's death in 1972.

**Support:**

* Some FBI officials privately say Ms. Doucette's complaints are well-founded.
* A group of female agents calling itself Special Agent Women Interested in Fair Treatment began sending agents a newsletter about issues affecting female agents, but the group's leaders do not publicly identify themselves.

**Context:**

* The FBI has hired women in increasing numbers in recent years, with 11% (over 1,200) of its 10,300 agents being women.
* Despite this progress, many women remain skeptical about the depth of the agency's commitment to the future of women at the FBI."

The movement is led by a coalition of labor unions, environmental groups, and community organizations, who are concerned that NAFTA will lead to job losses, environmental degradation, and a decline in living standards.

The article highlights the diversity of the coalition, which includes Chinese-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Gray Panthers, college students, and followers of various politicians. The group is united by their opposition to NAFTA and their desire to protect California's economy and environment.

The article also mentions that the campaign has been successful in mobilizing public opinion against NAFTA. A poll is cited showing that the more people learn about NAFTA, the less they like it. Additionally, several politicians are quoted as saying that they have been influenced by the protests and are now opposed to the agreement.

Some of the specific tactics used by the coalition include:

* Picketing and demonstrating
* Sending out postcards and flyers
* Manpowering phone banks
* Stocking volunteers with materials

The article also highlights the personal stories of some of the protesters, including Gladys Mendelson, a 39-year-old member of the communications workers union who is involved in the campaign. Her concerns about NAFTA are driven by her desire to protect jobs and the environment.

Overall, the article suggests that the anti-NAFTA movement in California has been successful in mobilizing public opinion and influencing politicians. The coalition's diverse membership and grassroots approach have helped to build a strong and effective opposition to the agreement."

3. (29) Vigiling silent protest holding placards, banners: Similar to point 2, this activity refers to the same type of silent protest, but with an emphasis on holding placards or banners.
4. (98) Other activity: This category includes activities that don't fit into any of the previous categories. In this case, it might refer to the parents' occupation of Public School 156 for 10 days, which was a form of sit-in protest against the school's closure.

9311002,647857,"What a fascinating virtual foreign policy crisis!

It appears that President Clinton's administration has been facing significant challenges in securing approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The stakes are high, as failure to pass NAFTA would not only undermine the US's credibility as a global leader but also have far-reaching consequences for international trade and economic integration.

The article highlights the importance of NAFTA as a defining moment in post-cold-war foreign policy. It is seen as a crucial step towards creating a new architecture for global trade, which would establish the United States as a key player in shaping the future of international commerce.

Experts warn that rejection of NAFTA would not only damage the US's reputation but also undermine efforts to complete the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by December 15. This would erode the US's moral authority to persuade other countries to support freer trade, making it harder to secure expanded markets for American exports.

Furthermore, the article suggests that a failure to pass NAFTA would send a negative message to allies around the world, particularly in Asia and Latin America, where leaders are eager to access the North American free-trade zone. This could lead to a decline in US influence and credibility on the global stage.

In conclusion, this virtual foreign policy crisis highlights the importance of securing approval for NAFTA as a crucial step towards shaping the future of international trade and economic integration. Failure to pass NAFTA would have far-reaching consequences for the US's reputation and its ability to shape global affairs."
9311004,648616,"This article discusses the ongoing dispute between Canada and the United States over subsidies in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The issue has been unresolved since the original free trade agreement was signed six years ago. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien is demanding that the US agree to a code governing subsidies to avoid misunderstandings and retaliatory duties.

The article quotes various Canadian officials, including Tim Page from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Daniel Schwanen from the C.D. Howe Institute, who believe that the issue can be addressed through continuing trade talks without renegotiating the entire agreement.

Some American supporters of NAFTA fear that Canada's demands will give opponents more ammunition to defeat the agreement in Congress. However, Canadian business leaders and officials are confident that an accord can be reached.

The article also highlights Canada's dependence on trade with the US, with exports accounting for 40% of its private sector output. One in five Canadian jobs is directly dependent on exports, three-quarters of which head south to the US.

Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren has proposed negotiations over side agreements similar to those on labor and environmental standards initiated by President Clinton after he came to office. This approach aims to address Canada's concerns without reopening the basic text of the agreement.

The article concludes that while the issue is complex, both governments are confident that an accord can be reached through ongoing trade talks and parallel negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)."
9311006,650286,"This article discusses the intense lobbying efforts by the White House and labor unions as President Clinton's administration tries to pass a trade agreement with Mexico. The key points mentioned in the article are:

1. The White House is pushing hard for the vote, with President Clinton himself meeting with undecided lawmakers to persuade them.
2. Labor unions are opposing the agreement, arguing that it will lead to job losses and lower wages.
3. Some undecided lawmakers have been leaning towards supporting the pact after being promised protection for their constituents' interests.
4. The Administration has made concessions to certain groups, such as Florida farmers, who would be affected by foreign competition.
5. Tensions are high, with some lawmakers feeling threatened or resentful of labor union tactics.

The article highlights the intense political pressure and arm-twisting that is happening on both sides of the issue. It also notes that the White House has promised to protect certain interests, such as Florida crops, which could have implications for other nations involved in global trade talks."

9312012,655969,"This article reports on a lawsuit filed by Orthodox Jews against the village of Airmont in New York after the village restricted the construction of home synagogues. The plaintiffs claimed that the restrictions violated their Constitutional rights to free exercise of religion and fair housing.

The jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the village had violated their rights. However, the verdict did not award any damages to the plaintiffs, which was seen as a victory for the village.

The lawsuit was sparked by Rabbi Yitzchok LeBlanc-Sternberg's attempts to build a home synagogue in his neighborhood, which were opposed by village officials who claimed that it would detract from the residential character of the area. The Orthodox community argued that they needed such houses of worship because they are unable to travel by car on the Sabbath.

The lawsuit also raised concerns about anti-Semitism and discrimination against Orthodox Jews. While the jury rejected these claims, the plaintiffs' lawyers argued that the village's actions were motivated by a desire to exclude Orthodox Jews from the community.

The case has drawn national attention and has been seen as a symbol of the cultural tensions between Orthodox Jews and other communities in suburban New York. The dispute has mirrored similar conflicts that have occurred across the country as small, mostly conservative sects of many faiths have sought to establish themselves in less urban, and often less welcoming, settings.

The case will now go before Judge Gerard L. Goettel, who is expected to rule on a companion federal suit against the village. The judge has indicated that he sees some inconsistencies in the jury's decision and may reverse it."

9312019,656421,"This news article reports on a landmark settlement in a sex discrimination lawsuit against Lucky Grocery Stores. The settlement requires the company to pay damages averaging $5,000 each to about 14,000 women who were channeled into dead-end jobs or lower-paying positions, rather than being promoted to better-paid and more prestigious roles.

The lawsuit was filed by several women who claimed that they were subjected to sex discrimination at Lucky's, which was a pattern of segregation between men and women in the company. The women alleged that they were denied training opportunities and promotions, and instead were relegated to jobs such as working cash registers or in bakeries and delicatessens.

The settlement is significant because it requires Lucky's to revise its personnel practices under court supervision and to pay additional damages of up to $13 million if specific targets for hiring and promotion are not met. The total potential payout could reach $107.25 million, making it the second-largest sex discrimination settlement in history.

The lawsuit also has implications beyond Lucky's, as it sets a precedent for other grocery chains and employers. The settlement demonstrates that assigning jobs and promoting workers based on stereotypes about women will no longer be tolerated, and that employers must take steps to ensure equal opportunities for all employees.

In terms of the chances for promotion, the settlement requires Lucky's to provide training opportunities and promote women into better-paid and more prestigious roles. This could lead to increased career advancement opportunities for women at the company.

Overall, the settlement is a significant victory for the plaintiffs and has important implications for employers and equal employment opportunity advocates."

9401001,659306,"The leaders of the Fourth Reich skinhead group, who were involved in four bombings, including one at a synagogue, participated in a three-day counseling program. The program aimed to confront their hate and encourage them to change their beliefs.

During the program, the participants met with Holocaust survivors, visited a Federal courtroom and a men's central jail, and engaged in therapy sessions. They also watched the movie ""Schindler's List"" about a German businessman who saved the lives of over 1,000 Jews during World War II.

By the end of the program, some of the participants had expressed regret for their beliefs and actions. One participant, Turtle, renounced his affiliation with the Fourth Reich and said he no longer wanted to be associated with people who kill for no reason. Another participant, Tim, said that the program had helped him see the error of his ways.

The program was led by Rabbi Israel Greenstein, who believed that by sharing their stories and experiences, Holocaust survivors could help young people like the Fourth Reich skinheads to change their beliefs and behaviors.

In one particularly powerful moment, a 63-year-old Auschwitz survivor named Si Frumkin asked the participants why they wanted to kill his grandchildren. This led to a heated discussion about the senselessness of hate and violence.

The program's leader, Mr. Greenstein, hoped that the experience would give the participants an alternative for their future and encourage them to participate in society rather than prey on it.

**Case Summary**: Gailen Lucas, a 3-year-old boy, was removed from his biological mother's care in 1990 due to her drug and alcohol abuse. He has since been placed with at least six foster homes until being adopted by Ross and Louis Lopton, two gay men.

**Mother's Objection**: Gailen's biological mother, Mrs. Lucas, is now fighting in court to regain custody of her son. She argues that she was coerced into giving up parental rights to the state and is now petitioning to adopt him herself.

**Competing Adoption Plans**: The Washington State Court of Appeals will consider competing adoption plans filed by both sets of parents (Lucas and Loptons) on January 28th.

**Gay Rights Issue**: The case has become a cause célèbre for anti-gay rights groups in Washington state, who are using it to push for legislation prohibiting adoptions by same-sex couples. Gay rights groups argue that Mrs. Lucas is being used as a pawn by these groups and that the focus should be on finding a stable home for Gailen.

**Mother's Background**: Mrs. Lucas has had a troubled past, including drug and alcohol abuse, arrests for larceny and burglary, and periods of incarceration. She claims to have stabilized her life since marrying her husband in 1992 and having a daughter with him.

**Father's Absence**: Gailen's biological father is not involved in the case and has not come forward.

**Legal Battles**: The court has initially ordered Gailen to be placed with the Lucases, but this was later overturned. A December 10th ruling postponed the order until the appeals court can review it."

9401004,659819,"This article reports on a series of church burnings that took place in Mississippi, specifically at the Springhill Freewill Baptist Church and Rocky Point Missionary Baptist Church. The incident sparked widespread outrage and fear among the black community, evoking memories of the 1960s when similar violence was rampant.

The investigation into the arson attacks initially moved slowly, with no arrests or charges filed for several weeks. However, state and federal officials eventually agreed to prosecute the case as a Federal civil rights violation, resulting in mandatory prison sentences for three of the four youths involved.

In the aftermath of the incident, a unique community effort emerged, with volunteers from 38 churches, black and white, coming together to rebuild the Springhill church. This initiative brought people together across racial lines, fostering a sense of unity and healing.

The article highlights the resilience and hope that has emerged in the face of adversity, as well as the ongoing struggle for racial understanding and reconciliation in Mississippi. While some individuals still express concerns about underlying racial hostility, many others see this event as an opportunity to ""make it right"" and move forward.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

9401033,664384,"This article discusses a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for Women (NOW) against anti-abortion groups and individuals, including Operation Rescue, alleging a nationwide conspiracy to intimidate and harass abortion clinics through violent acts such as bombings, vandalism, and harassment of staff members.

The lawsuit, which was initially dismissed by two lower federal courts in Chicago, claims that the defendants' actions violated the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a federal law designed to combat organized crime. The Supreme Court has now reinstated the suit, ruling that the RICO law does not require an economic motive for the alleged criminal activities.

The decision allows NOW to proceed with its lawsuit, which seeks damages and injunctive relief against the anti-abortion groups and individuals accused of engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. The case is significant because it highlights the tension between anti-abortion protests and the rights of abortion clinics to operate without intimidation or harassment.

In related news, the Supreme Court has also agreed to hear another abortion protest case that directly poses First Amendment questions. In Madsen v. Women's Health Center, No. 93-880, anti-abortion demonstrators are challenging an injunction issued by a judge to create a protest-free buffer zone at an abortion clinic in Melbourne, Florida.

**Issue:** Denial of health benefits to same-sex couples by Rutgers University.

**Protesters:** The five employees who began the lawsuit, joined by the Rutgers chapter of the American Association of University Professors, on behalf of all lesbian and gay and bisexual employees who have life partners and are denied benefits.

**Reasons for Protest:** The university's refusal to extend health benefits to same-sex couples, citing state law as a reason. The protesters argue that this is discriminatory and goes against the university's own nondiscrimination policies.

**Demands:** The lawsuit seeks benefits retroactive to 1981, when the university adopted a policy saying it would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

**Supporters:** The New Jersey American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has been supporting the cause, with lawyer Marsha Wenks arguing that the decision to deny health benefits goes against the university's policies.

**Background:** Rutgers University is one of the few public institutions in the country that does not offer health benefits to same-sex couples. While some private colleges and universities have extended such benefits, there has been resistance from other institutions, including Ohio State University, where a proposal for same-sex couples to live in married student housing was met with opposition.

6. **Settlement terms**: The settlement included improvements in hourly wages and benefits, although it did not fully repay workers for concessions made in 1986. The new contract would run for two and a half years instead of the usual five years.
7. **Reaction from union officials**: Union leaders were pleased with the settlement, calling it ""one of the best contracts in the industry.""
8. **Impact on industry**: The strike was seen as a rare event in an industry that has experienced significant changes and decline since the 1980s.

Overall, this article suggests that the steel industry has undergone significant transformations, including globalization, technological advancements, and consolidation, which have led to shrinking revenues and job losses. Despite this backdrop, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh strike was viewed as a minor event in contract negotiations between a union willing to compromise and a company that had pioneered worker participation in management."

9403013,674708,"Here are the protest-related information extracted from the news article:

**Protest/Dispute:** The April 23 prom was threatened to be canceled by Principal Humphries due to racial tensions and discriminatory remarks.

**Trigger:** On February 24, Principal Humphries summoned juniors and seniors to a meeting where he asked how many planned to bring a date of a different race to the prom. When several hands went up, including that of Revonda Bowen, who is biracial, Mr. Humphries announced he was canceling the prom to prevent ""anyone from getting hurt.""

**Inciting Incident:** Principal Humphries told Revonda Bowen, 16, the president of the junior class, that she was a mistake because her parents were of different races.

**Response:** The next day, after parents complained, Mr. Humphries rescinded his cancellation of the prom, citing concerns about recent fights over interracial couples.

**Protest/Dispute Escalation:** The incident sparked racial tensions and protests at school, leading to:

* Self-imposed segregation among parents attending a school board meeting
* Cheering by black parents when Mr. Humphries was suspended, and white parents when it became clear he would continue to receive his salary
* A lawsuit filed on behalf of Revonda Bowen against the Randolph County School Board and Principal Humphries for violating her constitutional rights and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act

**Support:** Supporters of Principal Humphries formed a 100-car motorcade rally in his name, describing him as a disciplinarian who helped prevent disorder over desegregation in the 1970s.

**Aftermath:** The incident has shaken Mr. Humphries' order at school, leading to increased tensions and conflicts between black and white students, including bomb threats and racial slurs."
9403015,675651,"The article reports on a series of mysterious killings targeting Haitian exiles in Miami, Florida, which has sparked concerns about political intimidation and assassination. The victims, including Daniel Buron, were all associated with the Veye Yo organization, which promotes the overthrow of Haiti's military leaders and the restoration of Father Aristide.

The authorities initially downplayed any connection between the killings and politics, instead suggesting that they may be linked to drug dealing or personal disputes. However, Haitian exiles and human rights advocates argue that the murders are part of a larger campaign of terror orchestrated by the Haitian military government against its opponents in exile.

The article mentions several specific cases, including the shooting deaths of Jean-Claude Olivier, Fritz Dor, and Dona St. Plite, all of whom were involved in promoting Aristide's return to power through radio broadcasts and political activism. The murders have been linked to a hit list circulated in Little Haiti, which praises Haiti's military government and proclaims that those on the list should be killed.

The article also highlights the concerns of Haitian exiles about their safety and the failure of authorities to take seriously the political dimension of these crimes. A spokesperson for Father Aristide's government-in-exile has accused ""transnational terrorists"" supported by Haiti's military-run government of being responsible for the killings.

Overall, the article suggests that the murders are part of a broader campaign of intimidation and violence aimed at silencing opponents of the Haitian military government and preventing Aristide from returning to power."

9403023,677156,"Based on this news article, former intelligence officers have stated that few women hold positions of real power in the Directorate of Operations (D.O.) at the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). Women are underrepresented in roles such as case officers, recruiting and controlling foreign agents, and station chiefs. The agency's Director, R. James Woolsey, has expressed a desire to change this situation, but progress is slow.

The article highlights the lack of senior women in the C.I.A.'s clandestine service, with one former spy stating that there was a ""glass ceiling"" for women seeking careers as case officers. Another woman who worked at the agency recalled that women were often expected to fill secretarial roles rather than taking on more covert or analytical positions.

The article also notes that the C.I.A. has taken steps to address these issues, including increasing the representation of women in senior positions and undertaking a ""glass ceiling study"" in 1991. However, despite progress, the agency still faces challenges in promoting women to top positions.

The article suggests that a class-action lawsuit could be filed on behalf of the women at the C.I.A., which would involve issues of secrecy, national security, and feminism. The case would likely be sealed by a Federal judge at the agency's request, and the general counsel, Elizabeth Rindskopf, would have to defend the agency if the suit is filed.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by women in the C.I.A.'s Directorate of Operations, including limited opportunities for advancement and a lack of role models or mentors."

9404040,681136,"A challenging strike dismissal case! Here are the key points extracted from the news article:

**Background**: The strike began 2.5 years ago over wages at Diamond Walnut, a cooperative owned by 2,000 growers. Two-thirds of the strikers are women who have been earning $200 a week in strike pay, which is half to two-thirds of their pre-strike wage.

**The Dispute**: The union (Teamsters Local 601) sought a raise of another dollar an hour, but Diamond offered only 10 cents and bonuses. This led to the workers walking out on September 4, 1991.

**The Replacement Workers**: Diamond had anticipated the strike and hired new workers to replace the strikers. These replacement workers are mainly younger men who make an average hourly wage of $8.50, similar to what the strikers were earning before the strike.

**The Company's Position**: Diamond claims that it owes a debt to the replacement workers for their efforts in saving the company during its biggest harvest ever in 1991. The company argues that using permanent replacement workers is necessary to stay in business.

**Government Intervention**: Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich sent the head of his women's bureau, Karen Nussbaum, to investigate the strike. He also won both sides' agreement to discuss their differences with John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

**Union Perspective**: The union sees the use of permanent replacement workers as a way for Diamond to break the union and undermine its effectiveness. Strikers like Ms. Goodin, Cynthia Zavala, Goldie Fuqua, and Judy Sullivan are angry about being replaced and feel that Diamond is not living up to its commitment to the original workers.

**The Replacement Workers' Perspective**: Some of the replacement workers, like Mark Hanson, see themselves as temporary help during a difficult time for the company. They argue that they have earned their jobs and deserve loyalty from Diamond.

This strike dismissal case highlights the ongoing struggle between labor unions and employers over issues like wages, benefits, and job security. The government's intervention suggests that there may be a need for regulation or mediation to ensure fair treatment of workers in such situations."

9304012,686922,"Here are some key points extracted from the news article:

**Background**: The vote was a defeat for anti-abortion lawmakers who argued that the measure aimed to curb violence against abortion providers rather than targeting peaceful civil disobedience.

**Bill Provisions**: The bill imposes fines and prison terms on individuals who use force, threats, or physical obstruction to interfere with abortion services. It also allows clinic employees and clients to sue protesters in Federal court for damages.

**Opposition**: Opponents argued that the bill targets anti-abortion protesters' right to peaceful civil disobedience, which is protected by the First Amendment. They claimed that the bill's provisions were overly broad and would criminalize nonviolent acts like sit-ins and chaining oneself to doorways.

**Support**: Supporters of the bill, led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, argued that it was necessary to protect women's right to choose and prevent violence against abortion providers. They pointed out that abortion clinics have been targeted in over 1,000 attacks in the last decade.

**Key Quotes**:

* Senator Robert C. Smith: ""Some day this is going to haunt you... There's going to be another political issue that you're on the other side of, and you're going to regret this vote.""
* Senator Don Nickles: ""The real target is thought, not behavior."" He argued that the bill does not treat all groups that engage in peaceful civil disobedience equally.
* Senator Barbara Boxer: ""If doctors are driven away from providing the full range of reproductive health services to women, including abortion, and health-care clinics are closed, a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion if she so chooses will become meaningless.""

9405022,687137,"The article reports on protests and controversy surrounding the ""Re-Imagining"" conference held from November 4-7, which aimed to rethink Christian concepts through a feminist lens. The meeting featured discussions on God, Jesus, church, family, sexuality, community, and ministry, with a focus on the biblical concept of Sophia (wisdom).

The conference has faced criticism from conservative groups within the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), who accuse organizers of promoting ""worship of the goddess Sophia"" and undermining traditional Christian beliefs. The controversy has sparked heated debate, with some calling for staff members involved in planning the event to be penalized.

Some of the specific criticisms include:

* A speaker's call for lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual women to join her onstage, which was met with applause from the audience.
* Quotes from conference speakers that are seen as provocative or undermining of traditional Christian beliefs.
* The use of language in prayer that is seen as sensual or erotic.

Defenders of the conference argue that these criticisms are out of context and that the meeting was a serious theological discussion, not an attack on Christianity. They also accuse critics of trying to stifle discussion and disparaging women.

The controversy has already led to a significant drop in contributions to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), with estimated losses of over $2.5 million by the end of 1995. The issue is expected to dominate the denomination's General Assembly in June, according to church officials.

Overall, the ""Re-Imagining"" conference has sparked a heated debate within Christian denominations, highlighting ongoing tensions between traditional and progressive views on faith and theology."
9405026,688016,"This article reports on a federal court case brought by Shannon Faulkner against The Citadel, a South Carolina military college, challenging the institution's all-male admissions policy. Faulkner, a 19-year-old cadet, sought to join the corps of cadets, the college's main student body, but was denied due to the school's single-sex education tradition.

The case is significant as it tests the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and raises questions about the benefits of single-sex education, male bonding, feminist theory, and the limits of equal protection under the law. The Citadel's lawyers argue that the college performs a unique function in South Carolina's educational landscape, which has been separate but equal.

The main arguments presented by both sides are:

* Lawyers for Faulkner argue that the exclusion of women is discriminatory and that The Citadel should be required to admit her to comply with constitutional protections. They also point out that the college has welcomed women into its auxiliary programs while denying them access to the cadet corps.
* Lawyers for The Citadel argue that including women would irreparably harm the institution's unique culture, academic studies, and discipline.

Two basic issues were identified by Judge C. Weston Houck:

1. Whether The Citadel can justify its single-sex role within the context of South Carolina's educational system.
2. If not, whether they can provide a remedy like that proposed by Virginia Military Institute (V.M.I.), which was required to ensure women have access to similar training at an alternate site.

The case has implications for the education landscape in South Carolina and beyond, as it raises questions about the benefits of single-sex education, male bonding, and feminist theory."

9405035,689440,"The article reports that Denny's, a popular restaurant chain, has settled three Federal class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of thousands of black customers who alleged discrimination and poor treatment. The suits were filed in Baltimore, San Jose, and Virginia, and accused Denny's of violating civil rights by treating black customers rudely and giving preferential treatment to whites.

The article describes several incidents where black customers were treated unfairly, including a Federal judge from Houston and his wife being forced to wait for an hour at a Denny's in California while white teenagers taunted them. In another case, six black Secret Service agents assigned to President Clinton's detail were refused a table at a Denny's in Maryland.

The settlement requires Denny's to pay $46 million to the customers and their lawyers, with any remaining funds going to the United Negro College Fund and other civil rights organizations. The company also agreed to hire a lawyer specializing in civil rights to enforce the consent decree and monitor for any future discrimination.

The article suggests that the settlements reflect a renewed focus on civil rights enforcement by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which had suffered from criticism and lack of leadership during the previous administration. The settlements also highlight the persistence of racial discrimination in American society, despite progress made since the 1960s.

Some lawyers representing the black customers described Denny's as having a pervasive attitude of discrimination that permeated its management levels, while others testified about training sessions where managers were taught how to deal with ""too many"" blacks in a restaurant at once. The company's CEO denied any policy or practice of discrimination, but acknowledged that some incidents may have been random.

The article concludes by noting that the settlement is unlikely to have a significant impact on Flagstar's bottom line, given the company's diverse portfolio of franchises and strong financial performance."

3. (28) Vigiling: Although not explicitly mentioned as ""vigiling"", the article describes the protesters being pried loose by local police and firefighters after more than an hour of protest, which suggests a form of vigiling or silent protest.

9406019,692717,"The main point of this article is that anti-abortion groups are finding ways to avoid paying judgments against them for disrupting abortion clinics. According to Roger Evans, litigation director of Planned Parenthood, the problem is finding assets owned by these groups, which often operate with small amounts of cash and other organizations collecting money on their behalf.

Some notable points made in the article include:

1. The anti-abortion groups have become ""judgment-proof"" since court judgments against them began.
2. Many anti-abortion leaders have few or no assets to begin with, making it difficult for abortion clinics to collect damages.
3. Anti-abortion leaders like Randall Terry and Wendy Wright acknowledge that they have no assets worth taking and are living off donations.
4. The government has also struggled to collect contempt fines against the groups, with only $2,343 collected in a New York case out of over $500,000 owed.
5. Abortion rights lawyers are now seeking help from lawyers who successfully used large damage awards to batter white supremacist groups.

Overall, the article suggests that while anti-abortion groups may be facing legal consequences for their actions, they have found ways to avoid paying damages and continue their activities with relative impunity."

* The vandalism, which started in late April, has targeted only 6-7 houses, mostly Jewish homes, with eggs and occasional rocks.
* The police have been withholding details, citing confidentiality, but most suspicion falls on Glen Ridge High School students.
* Many Jewish residents are hesitant to speak out against the attacks, feeling that it might attract more trouble or make waves in the community.
* Some residents, like Rabbi Steven Kushner of Temple Ner Tamid, believe that as long as the attacks remain minor and don't escalate, they should be handled quietly by the police.
* Others, like Nancy Mamis-King, a Jewish resident who has not been directly affected but is active in community affairs, feel that silence is intolerable and that something needs to be done to address the issue.
* The town's superintendent, Anne Wilkins, has expressed concern about bias-related incidents in the community and notes that tolerance lessons are included in the school curriculum.
* Mr. Castro, a black resident who has been targeted by the vandalism, is adamant about wanting more public attention focused on the attacks and feels that eggs can be just as damaging as rocks when motivated by racism.

Overall, the incident highlights the tension between keeping quiet to avoid provoking further trouble and speaking out against discrimination and bias."

**Protest**: A group of authors and historians have raised concerns about the environmental and historical impact of Disney's America theme park project.

**Disruption**: The additional layer of opposition is expected to widen the focus of debate and potentially force Disney to choose an alternative site.

**Support**: Many Virginians, including Governor George Allen, Senator John W. Warner, and local officials, support the project, citing its economic benefits, including 19,000 permanent jobs, 2,800 construction jobs, $48 million a year in new state taxes, and up to $12 million for Prince William County.

**Concerns**: Opponents argue that the theme park would lead to increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and development that could overwhelm existing neighborhoods and endanger historic sites. They are calling on Disney to build elsewhere and urging Federal agencies to ensure compliance with laws governing air quality, transportation, and historic preservation.

**Regulatory hurdles**: To force Disney to choose an alternative site, opponents believe that lawmakers would need to insist that Disney's plans strictly meet the standards of Federal statutes like the Clean Air Act and the Inter-Modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act."

9407001,696694,"Here are some key points extracted from the article:

1. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of an injunction protecting a Florida abortion clinic and upholding a ban on excessive noise during operating hours, but struck down a 300-foot buffer zone around the clinic.
2. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the buffer zone ""burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.""
3. The Court found that a smaller buffer zone or restrictions on demonstration size and duration would be constitutional.
4. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that the decision was an attack on free speech and comparing it to the 1944 Supreme Court decision upholding Japanese-American internment during World War II.
5. The majority opinion held that the injunction was not directed at the message of the anti-abortion protesters, but rather aimed at preventing interference with patients entering and leaving the clinic.
6. The Court established a higher First Amendment standard for injunctions than for general laws, requiring that they burden ""no more speech than necessary to serve a significant governmental interest.""
7. Justice John Paul Stevens disagreed with the majority's analysis and would have upheld the 300-foot buffer zone around the Florida clinic.

Overall, the Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutional right of abortion clinics to protect their patients from interference while also limiting the reach of anti-abortion protests."
9407003,696747,"The article reports on a controversy surrounding Deputy Mayor Randy Dyson's comments about racial relations in New York City. Mr. Dyson was quoted as saying that the advice would still cost the same whether there were one firm or two firms advising on the city's bond sales, which led Comptroller Alan Hevesi to accuse him of trying to split the business between two firms.

In a subsequent interview, Mr. Dyson disputed this claim and said each firm had presented a bid for a fixed fee, making it half as expensive to hire one firm rather than two. When asked about his comment that the Comptroller ""ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon,"" Mr. Dyson apologized for any offense caused and said he meant no racial slur.

However, the controversy only deepened, with Comptroller Hevesi calling Mr. Dyson's remarks ""irresponsible and insensitive"" and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone labeling them as ""clearly a racist statement."" Other officials, including Public Advocate Mark Green and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, also condemned Mr. Dyson's comments.

The dispute has implications for the city's bond sales, with two important transactions scheduled for July. The controversy may delay or even cancel these deals, which could have significant financial consequences for the city."

2. Selling buttons, bumper-stickers, books, frisbees bearing demo info, and so on (25): Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that pro-gun groups or organizations may have been selling materials with their message.
3. Sloganeering/chanting (28): The article does not mention specific chants or slogans, but the idea of rallying support for a cause is implicit in the descriptions of protests and demonstrations.
4. Wreathing/laying wreaths or floral arrangements on statues or memorials (32): This activity is not directly mentioned in the article, but it can be inferred that there may have been symbolic gestures like laying wreaths to express opposition to the assault weapon ban.

9407005,696894,"Here are the protest information extracted from the news article:

**Topic:** Kiryas Joel School District Controversy

**Protest Groups:**

1. **Critics of the arrangement**: Opponents of the bill argue that it fragments education and benefits only one sect, the Satmar Hasidim.
2. **New York State School Boards Association**: They are planning to challenge the new legislation in court, citing concerns about the separation of church and state.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Fragmentation of Education**: Critics argue that the bill creates a separate school district for Kiryas Joel, which will lead to fragmentation and Balkanization.
2. **Special Treatment for Satmar Hasidim**: Opponents claim that the bill favors one religious group over others, violating the principle of separation of church and state.

**Key Players:**

1. **Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver**: Sponsored the bill and argued that it addresses Justice O'Connor's concerns.
2. **Louis Grumet**: Executive director of the New York State School Boards Association, who brought the original court challenge against the Kiryas Joel district.
3. **Governor Cuomo**: Signed the Kiryas Joel legislation in 1989, citing his duty to protect and serve all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.

**Key Events:**

1. **Supreme Court Ruling**: The majority ruled that establishing the Kiryas Joel district was improper favoritism toward religion.
2. **Legislative Agreement**: Lawmakers reached an agreement on two bills dealing with Kiryas Joel, including one to establish new school districts and another to simplify teacher discipline procedures.

**Outcomes:**

1. **New School Districts**: The bill allows municipalities to create new school districts if they meet specific criteria.
2. **Teacher Discipline**: The bill simplifies the process for disciplining teachers accused of wrongdoing and bolsters their rights.
3. **Voter Registration**: The ""motor voter"" bill advances, requiring states to distribute voter registration applications in various state and local offices."
9407006,697484,"Based on the article, here are some key points related to protest and civil rights:

1. The lawsuit was supported by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and other civil rights groups.
2. The plaintiffs argued that the county's form of government did not meet the criterion of one person, one vote, or comply with the Federal Voting Rights Act.
3. The lawsuit led to a Federal District Court ruling by Judge Arthur D. Spatt, who upheld the plaintiffs' contention and ordered changes in Nassau County government.
4. The commission grew out of this ruling and was tasked with drawing new district lines that would ensure greater minority representation.
5. The Hispanic plaintiffs supported the commission's plan, which included two districts in the heart of Nassau where the majority of the population is black.
6. Black Democrats who served on the commission were initially critical of Republican control, but later praised the commission's plan as a step forward for minority representation.
7. However, the Democratic Party opposed the commission's plan, arguing that it favored the Republican Party and did not do enough to ensure equal representation.

Some quotes from the article that highlight the importance of civil rights and representation:

* ""We've been left out of the process of government far too long."" - Roger Corbin, a black resident of Westbury who served on the commission
* ""We're going to be checkmated."" - Roger Corbin, initially criticizing Republican control of the commission
* ""We're not going to make history by giving the Republicans a veto-proof legislature for the next 100 years."" - Lewis J. Yevoli, Supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay and one of four Democrats on the county board
* ""I think the plaintiffs are frustrated. They've been waiting a long time for this and they perceive the Democratic opposition in some way as opposition to their cause... but that's simply not true."" - Bruce Nyman, a Democrat and Supervisor of the City of Long Beach"

1. Praying (21): The article mentions that the protesters picketed in front of the clinics, but it doesn't specify any specific forms of prayer or religious activities.
2. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (20): The protesters held signs and picketed outside the clinics, which fits this category.
3. Sloganeering/chanting chanting same small sets of words (28): Although the article doesn't mention specific chants or slogans, it does describe the protesters' actions as a ""picket"" and mentions that they were ""outnumbered by police officers"", suggesting some sort of collective activity or chanting.
4. Lobbying any mention of lobbying, local, state, fed government (40): The article mentions that the anti-abortion groups are planning to block the entrance to a Little Rock clinic on Friday, which could be seen as a form of lobbying or advocating for their cause through direct action.

Please note that these categories might not be exact matches with the specific actions described in the article."
9407018,698995,"Protest Information:

* Organization: National Conference of Catholic Bishops
* Goal: To exclude abortion services from any standard benefits package in health care reform legislation and to promote conscience protections for individuals and institutions that object to abortion on moral or religious grounds.
* Method:
	+ Distributing the results of a national poll showing widespread support for universal health care coverage but opposition to including abortion services among required benefits.
	+ Meeting with Congressional leaders, including Speaker Thomas S. Foley, to express concerns and seek support.
	+ Mobilizing Catholics through personal visits to political leaders, parishioners, and church organizations.
	+ Launching a stepped-up effort to press opposition home in Congress.
* Target Audience: Members of Congress, particularly those who are personally ambivalent about abortion coverage or whose constituents are strongly opposed to including it.
* Key Message: The inclusion of abortion services in any standard benefits package would violate Catholic moral principles and the ""First Amendment right of religious freedom,"" and would force millions of employers, churches, and individuals to subsidize abortion in violation of their consciences."

9407020,699033,"A fascinating case! It seems that Cheryl Hopwood, a white applicant, was rejected from the University of Texas Law School despite having similar qualifications as minority applicants who were accepted. Her lawsuit against the university argues that the school's affirmative action policies unfairly discriminate against whites and could set a precedent for making it more difficult for universities nationwide to implement such policies.

The case is significant because it challenges the long-standing practice of considering race and ethnicity in university admissions, particularly in law schools. The university defends its policy by arguing that it helps redress past racial injustice and provides opportunities for minority students who might not have been admitted otherwise.

Interestingly, the case highlights the nuances of affirmative action policies, including the use of different criteria for minority applicants and the potential impact on white applicants like Hopwood. The trial has brought attention to the trade-offs involved in implementing such policies, with some arguing that they are necessary to achieve greater diversity and representation, while others see them as unfair and potentially discriminatory.

What do you think about this case? Do you believe that affirmative action policies can be effective in promoting diversity and addressing past injustices, or do you think they unfairly discriminate against certain groups?"

1 ; 20 ; 16 ; 15

Here's my reasoning:

* 1: Vigiling (silent protest holding placards, banners) - The advocates for the homeless handed out flyers, maps and subway tokens to homeless women in the park.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the protesters were holding signs with messages such as ""If the mayor won't protect you, then take this token and go to the park outside of Gracie Mansion"" and other similar slogans.
* 16: Meditation, ordinarily silent, silent meditation service - The protesters chose not to take the police at their word and instead engaged in a silent protest by handing out flyers and tokens.
* 15: Leafleting, distributing literature or tabling - As mentioned earlier, the protesters handed out flyers, maps and subway tokens to homeless women in the park."
9407023,700818,"Here are some key points about the protest or movement related to reparations:

* The movement is a grass-roots effort that includes petition drives and support from prominent black politicians, including Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative John Conyers Jr.
* The goal of the movement is to seek reparations for the descendants of slaves who were forcibly brought to America against their will
* Advocates of reparations argue that the US government has a moral obligation to make amends for the historical injustices suffered by African Americans, including slavery, segregation, and ongoing systemic racism
* Some proponents suggest that the form of compensation could include:
	+ Financial restitution, such as $20,000 per person or a one-time payment to all living black Americans
	+ Land or property to be distributed to descendants of slaves
	+ Unlimited college scholarships for blacks
	+ Establishment of a national museum devoted to the history of slavery
* Opponents argue that seeking reparations is futile and that efforts should instead focus on addressing present-day issues such as crime, unemployment, and teen-age pregnancy
* Some experts point out that identifying direct descendants of slaves would be a complicated and probably futile exercise, one compounded by a lack of historical records and vague definitions of who is -- and is not -- black.
* The movement has gained momentum in recent years, with some notable supporters including Representative Conyers, Spike Lee (who named his company 40 Acres and a Mule), Public Enemy, and KRS-One.

Overall, the movement for reparations is a complex issue that raises questions about historical injustice, moral responsibility, and social justice."

**Protest/Action:**

* Large group of summer students and faculty members cheered when Dean Warren Funk announced the decision to remain open.
* Faculty and staff have already made significant sacrifices, including cuts to administrative staff from 70 to 40 and elimination of 14 custodial positions.

**Background:**

* Upsala College has been struggling financially for several years, with enrollment dropping to a low of 475 full-time undergraduates in 1990.
* The college undertook a campaign to increase student numbers and brought enrollment up to just over 1,000 today, but still faces debt crisis.
* Borrowing at high interest rates contributed to the debt problem, which has put accreditation in jeopardy.

**Impact:**

* The college's accreditation is at risk of being revoked on December 31 if a solution is not found.
* If accreditation is lost, any credits granted by Upsala College would not be honored by other accredited undergraduate or graduate programs.
* Faculty and staff may go without pay for six to seven weeks until students arrive in the fall if state aid does not come through.

9408011,705516,"Based on the article, I code up to 4 protest activities as follows:

17 ; 20 ; 27 ; 42

Explanation:
17: Parading chariots - The article mentions a ""rallying cry"" and a T-shirt with the slogan ""1,952 Bulldogs and 1 Bitch"", which can be seen as a form of parading chariots to spread awareness about the issue.
20: Holding signs/picket line/placarding - The article mentions a bumper sticker ""Shave Shannon's Head"" which is being used as a rallying cry for keeping women out of The Citadel. This can be seen as holding signs or placards to express opposition.
27: Speechmaking/Testifying/Witnessing - The article quotes several lawyers and experts who testified in court about the issue, which can be seen as speechmaking or testifying in support of their arguments.
42: Singing collectively - Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, the idea of singing collectively is implied through the use of slogans and chants by protesters."
9408017,706893,"Here is the extracted protest information:

* None of Mr. Terry or Mr. Trewhella's speeches on the videotape mentioned abortion.
* Planned Parenthood officials said they received the tape in late May and gave a copy to the Justice Department after the shooting deaths of a doctor and his escort outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla., last month.
* The conference at which the tape was recorded featured speakers discussing homosexuality and male supremacy, as well as urging churches to ""teach their congregations to fight.""
* A 100-page ""field manual"" entitled ""Principles Justifying the Arming and Organizing of a Militia"" was distributed at the conference.
* The manual explores the morality, history, legality, and justifications for organizing militias.
* Planned Parenthood officials say there has been an increase in violence against their clinics nationwide since the killings in Pensacola.

Note: This information is related to protests or violent incidents against abortion clinics, but the main focus of the article is on the content of the videotape and the views expressed by Mr. Terry and Mr. Trewhella."
9408016,706897,"This news article reports on a dispute between black residents and the police department in Battleboro, North Carolina, which has led to a boycott of white-owned businesses and calls for a black police chief. The incident began when a nurse's aide, Mrs. Powell, was sprayed with Mace and charged with three misdemeanor counts of disobeying, resisting, and assaulting a police officer after an altercation with the police.

The article highlights the long-simmering complaints by blacks in Battleboro and other small towns about police harassment, which has been exacerbated by the lack of diversity on the police department, Board of Commissioners, and Planning Board. The only white men serve in these positions, and there are no black police officers or officials.

The boycott has had an economic impact on the town, with several businesses closing due to a loss of business. The article also notes that many blacks in Battleboro live outside the town limits and do not pay property taxes, but still receive water from the town at higher rates than those who live within the town limits. This has led to calls for annexation to gain political power and contest these fees.

The police chief, David Snyder, is a lone defender of his department's actions, which many see as overzealous and targeting black residents disproportionately. The article concludes by noting that the success of the Battleboro boycott may inspire similar protests in other small towns where accusations of police brutality are common."
9408018,707082,"Based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities as follows:

1 ; 20 ; 18 ; 29

Explanation:
- The first activity is likely 1 (Bannering or hanging banners on buildings) because the article mentions ""petitions signed by 500 of the village's 2,700 residents requesting the return of the streets"" which implies holding up signs and petitions.
- The second activity is 20 (Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing) as it describes villagers protesting with ""petitions signed by 500 of the village's 2,700 residents"".
- The third activity is 18 (Petitioning both obtaining signatures and presentation of petitions, letters signature) as it talks about Mayor Anthony Casella giving supervisors petitions requesting the return of the streets.
- The fourth activity is 29 (Vigiling silent protest holding placards, banners) as it describes village residents protesting with ""nothing against Ms. Banks"" but wanting all of East Williston in one district, which implies holding up signs and/or banners during a silent vigil."
9408021,708071,"The article discusses an effort by black churches in eight states with significant black voting populations to lobby for healthcare reform, particularly targeting senators who are opposed or undecided on the issue. The Summit '93 Health Coalition is organizing this effort, which includes radio commercials and a toll-free telephone number for congregants to call their representatives. The coalition is advocating for universal coverage, employer mandates, affordable coverage for all citizens, and funding for churches and community groups to educate people about health care and promote preventative measures.

The article highlights the four states where Senate races are crucial this fall: New York, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia. It also mentions Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina as other target states.

The organizers of the effort acknowledge that the healthcare issue lacks moral clarity compared to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. However, they believe that the lobbying campaign can still make a difference by emphasizing the need for black people's voices to be heard on this issue.

Some quotes from the article include:

* ""It's always important to think in the beginning, when you are designing a program, about the African-American community and how to get them to buy into that program."" - Elaine Jones, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
* ""I think there is a lesson in all of this for the administration."" - Elaine Jones
* ""Make our Senator make a difference. Your life could depend on it."" - Commercial paid for by the N.A.A.C.P.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of black churches and communities in shaping healthcare reform policy and advocating for their interests."
9408022,708099,"Based on the article, I have identified four protest activities:

1 ; 20 ; 21 ; 98

Here's my reasoning:

* 1: Bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, etc. - Although there is no direct mention of banner-hanging, the strike action by the UAW union local could be considered a form of ""bannering"" in that it is a public display of discontent.
* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The article mentions the strike action by the UAW union local, which likely involved holding signs and engaging in other forms of placarding to convey their message.
* 21: Praying - There is no direct mention of praying in the article, but prayer is often a form of protest or expression of concern for those affected by industrial actions.
* 98: Other activity - This code refers to activities that don't fit into any of the other categories. The strike action and protests by the UAW union local could be considered an ""other"" activity in that it doesn't fit neatly into one of the other categories."
9408024,708903,"Here are the protest activities that I have identified:

1; 20; 28; 97

In other words, based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities as follows:

* Bannering (1) - the exhibition will include photographs and documents from Japanese museums to represent different perspectives.
* Holding signs (20) - the veterans are holding placards with their concerns about the exhibition.
* Sloganeering/chanting (28) - the veterans are chanting slogans, such as ""The Americans are depicted as aggressors"" and ""The Japanese are depicted as victims"".
* Lawsuits and other legal maneuvers (97) - the 24 Congressmen sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution calling for changes to the exhibition."
9409001,709564,"Here are my answers in numeric format:

1 ; 20 ; 28 ; 27

So, the protest activities I coded are: 1 (bannering or hanging banners on buildings, bridges, etc.), 20 (holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing), 28 (vigiling silent protest holding placards, banners), and 27 (speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on)."
9409002,709576,"A Federal investigation into whether Community Access, an organization that provides housing for the mentally ill, was attempting to break Federal antidiscrimination housing laws by opposing the sale of a building to another bidder.

The investigation was prompted by rumors that opponents of the sale had made improper contacts with the seller and were trying to buy the building out from under Community Access. The opponents, who banded together as the Irving Place Community Coalition, denied any wrongdoing and said they only sent a petition with 2,000 signatures to the bank after it rejected the sale to Community Access.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) demanded that Community Access turn over its personal diaries, petitions, and phone messages, and threatened them with $50,000 fines. Although Community Access withdrew its complaint on Tuesday, civil libertarians and lawmakers have accused the Government of conducting a witch hunt that had a chilling effect on community protest.

Critics argue that the Government went too far in investigating the opponents' activities, saying that it is going beyond the limit of what is allowed under the Federal Fair Housing Act. They also say that there should be a finding or showing of probable cause before the Government invades the privacy of protesters.

The case has thrown into sharp relief the agency's conflicting demands of insuring the housing rights of the mentally ill and others with the free speech protections of the First Amendment. It poses the question: When does free speech cross the line into ""coercion, intimidation, and interference,"" which are forbidden under the Federal Fair Housing Act?

The dispute has also led to concerns that HUD will back off such cases in the future, hurting the mentally ill people who need housing."
9409010,711482,"This article discusses the lack of women in leadership positions within civil rights organizations, particularly within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.). The article highlights how the Chavis case has brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and discrimination against black women. Despite the majority of N.A.A.C.P.'s membership being female, only 15 out of 64 board seats are held by women, with men holding 10 of the top 12 executive positions.

The article also mentions how other black organizations are similarly dominated by men, with no prominent black women-led organizations. It notes that this lack of representation has led to a decrease in participation from younger black women who may not see opportunities for leadership within these organizations.

Critics argue that the N.A.A.C.P.'s lack of female leaders reflects a conflict rooted in generational as well as gender differences, with older black men reluctant to relinquish power and older black women accustomed to subordinate status. The article suggests that pressure is building for change, with some officials expressing concern about the organization's losing potential female members to other groups where they can lead and not be dominated by men.

The article highlights how issues important to black women, such as abortion, domestic violence, and pay equity, are often handled by white-led women's organizations. It also notes that civil rights groups need to change their attitudes toward women or risk losing potential members and issues."

9409021,713806,"Here is a summary of the protest information extracted from the news article:

**Protest Information:**

* The New York City public hospital system plans to lay off over 3,000 employees, which includes more than 15,000 unionized workers.
* The layoffs are part of a cost-cutting plan aimed at making the hospitals more competitive.
* Union leaders and elected officials have criticized the plan, saying it will devastate minority communities that rely heavily on the hospitals for employment.
* Protesters held a rally outside the hospitals agency's headquarters, with one union president stating, ""We will fight to the last drop of blood.""
* Other workers shared their concerns about the impact of layoffs, including understaffing and lack of basic supplies such as toilet paper and clean linens.
* The hospital system has not provided detailed information on how many jobs will be cut at each hospital, sparking concerns about transparency.

**Key Quotes:**

* ""We will fight to the last drop of blood."" - James Butler, president of Hospital Workers Local 420
* ""It would be the death of public hospitals in the city of New York."" - James Butler
* ""I don't know if waste and mismanagement is helpful to poor people any more than it is to wealthy people and I think there is a lot of waste in the system."" - Maria K. Mitchell, Mayor's special adviser on health care

* ""Asking churches, mosques and synagogues in New York City to contribute to his defense fund"" is a form of canvassing or asking for support (5).
* ""sent letters last week to 250 religious institutions, asking them to bring the effort to the attention of their congregants"" is also a form of canvassing or asking for support (5).
* ""a defense fund had been set up for Mr. Nelson and that it had sent letters..."" refers to petitioning, which involves obtaining signatures and presenting petitions (18).

9409026,715149,"This article discusses the campaign to pass Proposition 186, an initiative that would make California the first state to create a Canadian-style, or ""single payer,"" system for healthcare. The proposal would largely eliminate the role of private health insurance and replace it with a state-administered insurance system covering every resident.

The proponents of the proposition argue that the current system, which is heavily influenced by profit-minded insurance companies, is flawed and that a single-payer system would provide better care at lower costs. They also emphasize that this system would be financed by a combination of taxes, including a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes, an employer payroll tax, and new state income taxes.

On the other hand, the opponents argue that the proposition would force most people to give up their private health coverage and push them into a government-run healthcare bureaucracy. They also warn that the proposal would have a devastating impact on the state's economy, placing a burden on small businesses and potentially leading to job losses.

The article notes that the fight over Proposition 186 is part of a larger struggle for healthcare reform in California, which has been dubbed ""the battle moves to the states."" The opponents of the proposition are using many of the same arguments that were effective during the national debate over healthcare reform, while the proponents are emphasizing the potential benefits of a single-payer system.

The article also notes that there is a growing backlash against managed care and managed competition in California, which has led some doctors to take a fresh look at the concept of a single-payer system as a means of giving them more independence. However, the proposition's supporters acknowledge that it may be ahead of its time, but just barely.

Overall, this article highlights the complex and contentious issue of healthcare reform in California, and the challenges faced by proponents and opponents of Proposition 186."

3. Silent witness: The churches had sponsored an anti-abortion program called ""Life Chain,"" which was a silent and prayerful witness against abortion. Although this event was canceled for two years, it shows that there were protests happening in the past.

The vendors are supported by the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7, while other mosques, such as the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, have partnered with the Giuliani administration.

The community board in Central Harlem and economic development groups had pressured elected officials to reduce the number of vendors or remove them outright due to complaints about the situation getting out of hand. Some business owners and residents see the vendors as a nuisance, while others appreciate the attraction they bring to the area.

Some store owners stored the goods and equipment of vendors for a fee, and some sold their own goods on vending tables. The vendors have become a fixture on 125th Street, selling various items at bargain prices.

The division is not only between vendors and business owners but also among community members. Some residents appreciate the vendors, while others see them as a problem.

Some have suggested that the crucial opposition has come from merchants, development organizations, and those who contribute to political campaigns.

It remains unclear how long the vendors will be able to sustain their boycott, but there seems to be widespread agreement that 125th Street will be a different place regardless of the outcome."

The article highlights the growing opposition among ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, and African-Americans. Community organizers, civic leaders, and ordinary citizens are rallying against the proposition, arguing that it targets specific ethnic groups and will cause permanent damage to their communities.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* Leonardo Vilchis, a community organizer: ""We're getting the word out to our people about what this thing would really do to ethnic groups... People just hadn't been paying much attention until recently.""
* Jesse Laguna, pushing for passage of the proposition: ""An illegal Latino can very easily cost a Latino-American a job, and nobody understands that better than Americans.""
* Frank del Olmo, deputy editorial page editor of The Los Angeles Times: ""This campaign is desperate and cynical... will stick in our craws for generations.""

The article also mentions the opposition from influential Mexican-American voices, such as Frank del Olmo, and second-generation Japanese-American Miya Iwataki, who are organizing against the proposition.

Overall, the article suggests that while support for Proposition 187 was initially strong among white Californians, rising ethnic opposition could still impact its passage."
9411001,722229,"The proposition in question is likely Proposition 187, which was a ballot initiative that appeared on the November 8, 1994, general election ballot in California. The proposition aimed to deny most government services to illegal aliens, including schooling and non-emergency health care.

According to the article, there has been a sharp drop-off in support for the proposition, which was once heavily favored. Despite this, passage is still a real possibility due to the state's white majority's frustration with undocumented aliens continuing to slip into California and the cost of providing services to them rising.

The article highlights the concerns of various ethnic groups, particularly Hispanic-Americans, who are opposing the proposition. Many are worried about the potential negative impact on their communities and the perception that the campaign is driven by anti-ethnic hysteria.

The article also quotes Frank del Olmo, the deputy editorial page editor of The Los Angeles Times, who strongly opposes the proposition, arguing that it is ""desperate and cynical"" and will do permanent damage to an ethnic community he cares about.

Other opponents of the proposition include Ruben Rodriguez, a second-generation Mexican-American baker who worries about the potential impact on his family's success story; Miya Iwataki, a second-generation Japanese-American who fears that the measure is akin to the anti-ethnic hysteria that swept the country after Pearl Harbor during World War II.

The article also notes that while opposition to 187 is rising, particularly in ethnic communities, opponents of the proposition cannot escape the fact that ethnic opposition is not yet solid. Some minority groups are still undecided or may even support the measure."

9411009,725428,"Based on the article, here are some key points about the impact of artificial snowmaking on fish in rivers and streams:

* Artificial snowmaking by ski resorts can divert large amounts of water from nearby rivers and streams, potentially depleting them to dangerous low levels.
* This can harm brown trout, which incubate in gravel stream beds and hatch in the spring. Low water flows can freeze the streams and rip the fish eggs from the water bed.
* Some ski resorts are now diverting three or four times more water for snowmaking than they did a decade ago.
* The volume of water used for making snow is tiny compared to that diverted for agriculture, but it can still cause harm if concentrated on a certain stream.
* Environmental groups have raised concerns about the impact of artificial snowmaking on fish populations and are pushing for more sustainable practices.

1. Vigiling (silent protest holding placards, banners) - The inmates are refusing to perform their usual duties and instead are protesting through silence.
20. Holding signs (picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing) - Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the inmates are using placards or holding signs as part of their protest.
28. Sloganeering/chanting (chanting same small sets of words) - While not directly mentioned, it's possible that the inmates are chanting slogans or phrases to express their dissatisfaction and solidarity with each other.

9412009,728750,"The refugees could potentially come to the United States if Justice Department officials announce a plan on Friday. The Cuban-American community has offered to underwrite the relocation costs, with pledges of at least $15 million. The community's offer includes:

* Free flights from a volunteer aviator group
* Scholarships from Christian schools
* About 9,000 sponsors willing to take in families and guarantee that they will not become a public charge for at least a year

The Cuban refugees have been held in detention camps since August, when the Administration ordered their interception after thousands set out in boats and rafts for the United States due to worsening economic conditions in Cuba. The decision on the Cuban families' entry is expected to be based on humanitarian concerns, including age, health, and other factors.

It's worth noting that Gov. Lawton Chiles has expressed concerns about the cost of relocating the refugees and has sued the Federal Government to get it to pay expenses associated with illegal immigration into Florida."
9412012,728782,"This article discusses the ongoing dispute between civil rights leaders and local officials in Worcester County, Maryland over electoral system discrimination against black voters. The lawsuit was brought by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with Honiss Cane Jr. as the principal plaintiff.

The core issue is a voting system called post-at-large, which allows each voter to cast five votes, but only one vote counts in their own district, while the other four votes can be used to support candidates from any of the other four districts. This system has been deemed discriminatory by Judge Joseph H. Young of Federal District Court, who ordered the county to implement a cumulative voting system.

The county commissioners, led by John (Sonny) Bloxom, have appealed the decision and are considering taking it to the Supreme Court. However, this move was met with a threat from the NAACP to organize a boycott of Ocean City's tourist industry on Memorial Day if the appeal is pursued.

Edward H. Hammond, the lawyer for the county commissioners, criticized the threat, saying that civil rights leaders should respect the right of the county to have its day in court. Honiss Cane Jr., the plaintiff, saw nothing wrong with the boycott and believed it was a legitimate way to exert economic pressure on the county.

The article highlights the divergent views of race relations in Worcester County, with Mr. Bloxom believing that they are good, while Mr. Cane believes that they are ""simply real bad"". The dispute has led to polarization and tension between the two sides, making it difficult to reach a resolution.

Ultimately, the likely outcome is that the court will impose new regional boundaries to create a new district with a majority of black voters, which would require the county to redraw its electoral maps."
9412013,728823,"The article discusses a regulation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that prohibits foreign nationals from playing baseball in the United States during a strike. The regulation is intended to prevent replacement workers from being imported from other countries to replace striking major league players.

According to the article, the regulation would deny visas to foreign players seeking to play baseball in the US during a strike, effectively preventing clubs from importing players from Latin American countries, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Even Latin players under contract or reserve to major league clubs are expected to be affected by this regulation.

Several baseball players, including Rafael Palmeiro of the Baltimore Orioles and Terry Pendleton, have expressed their opposition to the regulation, calling it ""ridiculous"" and ""racist."" They believe that the owners are trying to degrade Latin players and assume that they will defect from the strike.

The article also mentions that the union plans to ask the immigration service to exclude players who were on 40-man major league rosters at the end of last season, as these players have demonstrated their ability to play in the major leagues. The union also intends to prevent minor league players from being used as replacement workers.

9412017,729074,"I've extracted the following information related to protests and immigration:

* Proposition 187 was passed in California, which aimed to cutoff education and health services for illegal immigrants.
* The proposition sparked a national debate over immigration and party unity, with some arguing that it was necessary to get Washington's attention on the issue of illegal immigration.
* Opponents argued that the proposition is unconstitutional and would hurt the Republican Party.
* The seven states with the largest immigrant populations account for two-thirds of the electoral votes needed to win the Presidency.
* The debate has become one of the most serious national debates in many years over whom to welcome, turn aside, or deport.
* There are concerns about the cost of government services to both illegal and legal immigrants, with estimates suggesting that together they receive over $8 billion annually.
* Proponents of Proposition 187 argue that it is symptomatic of a larger unease about immigration and that the influx of illegal and legal immigrants is straining government resources.
* Opponents argue that the proposition is too Draconian and will hurt a party that has traditionally been welcoming to immigrants.
* Recall campaigns have begun against school and municipal officials who opposed Proposition 187, and similar laws are being pushed in other states with large immigrant populations.
* The debate has sparked national attention, with President Clinton questioning the constitutionality of the proposition and dispatching extra immigration agents and border patrol equipment to California."

This event is not explicitly described as a protest, but it can be coded as a form of civil disobedience (45). However, since there is no evidence of organized protest or demonstration in the article, I have assigned a code of 0 for categories 2-41.
* The category ""holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing"" (20) seems to be the most relevant, as it describes a form of non-violent direct action where individuals use their bodies to convey a message.

9412023,729444,"The article is about the Free Speech Movement (FSM) at Berkeley University, which commemorated its 30th anniversary with a four-day reunion. The movement was marked by protests and sit-ins against university policies restricting free speech.

Some notable attendees included Jack Weinberg, who was arrested for handing out civil rights literature; Mario Savio, who became famous for urging students to bring the university machine to a stop with their bodies; and Jackie Goldberg, who later joined the Los Angeles City Council.

The reunion featured speeches, panel discussions, and nostalgia, including a hootenanny where movement veterans sang folk songs. The event also included a film showing, which highlighted the movement's early days when protesters were often depicted as bearded, unwashed characters with long hair and sandals.

Some attendees credited the FSM with spawning various social movements, including the anti-war movement, environmentalism, feminism, and teach-ins. Others noted that the movement had an equal and opposite reaction in the form of conservative politicians like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.

Despite some nostalgic moments, the event also addressed contemporary issues, such as Proposition 187, which would deny illegal immigrants health and welfare benefits. The attendees booed and hissed when one alumna defended the proposition, but later allowed her to continue speaking.

The article also mentions that Clark Kerr, Berkeley's president at the time of the FSM, was not in attendance and remained invisible and silent throughout the commemoration."

9412041,730227,"The protest outside Denny's on White Horse Pike near Atlantic City was an informational picket line organized by employees and their supporters from the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union (HEREIU). The union represents 400,000 members working mainly in upscale hotels and restaurants. The protest aimed to draw attention to the franchise operator's refusal to negotiate a contract with the upstart union.

The Denny's in Absecon is the only location among over 1,500 restaurants where service and kitchen workers have formed a union. Four days later, a Superior Court Judge ruled that seven people can picket outside Denny's at any one time, but cannot stand in the parking lot or be closer to each other than 10 feet.

The union is demanding better working conditions and benefits for the employees, who are paid minimum wages or dependent on tips. It's rare for workers in this industry to risk their jobs by demanding changes, as they can easily be replaced with new workers. The union believes that Denny's corporate office is behind the refusal to negotiate, fearing a successful contract at Absecon would encourage workers at other locations to organize.

The employees are protesting issues such as:

* Being forced to perform ""deep cleaning"" work between serving tables, like scrubbing garbage cans and storage spaces.
* Earning a starting wage of $2.13 an hour, with tips making up most of their income.
* Being required to do cleaning tasks during their shifts, reducing their tip earnings.

The union is seeking a fair contract that addresses these issues, but the franchise operator has refused to negotiate. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is investigating allegations of unfair labor practices at other Denny's locations in New Jersey and elsewhere."

9412044,730630,"The article discusses the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, which has been approved by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in May. The program aims to bring back 30 wolves over three years and is expected to generate an additional $19 million a year in new tourism dollars. However, ranchers are opposed to the program, citing concerns about livestock losses and the potential for wolves to cause trouble.

The article quotes various individuals involved in the debate, including biologist Ms. Askins of the Wolf Fund, who notes that wolf restoration is a symbolic act that has become entangled with cultural values and political fights over land use. She expects to close her organization's doors next year if the program is successful.

Ranchers are skeptical about the compensation fund set up by environmentalists to pay for livestock losses and worry that they may not have access to sufficient funds in the event of wolf attacks. They also argue that the reintroduction of wolves could lead to a broader expansion of protected areas, limiting their ability to use land for ranching.

The article notes that the Endangered Species Act provides protection for endangered species like wolves, but critics argue that this protection could be used to limit ranching activities in certain areas. The program has been met with resistance from various interest groups in the West, who view it as part of a broader fight over land use and environmental policies.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities and challenges surrounding wolf reintroduction, which is seen by some as a symbolic act that could have significant economic and cultural implications for the region."

9412062,730807,"Based on this news article, here are some key points about the trend of anti-gay rights initiatives:

1. The trend is fueled by religious conservatives who claim that gay rights laws threaten family values.
2. Gay rights advocates say that people are still easily swayed by anti-gay arguments due to misconceptions and ignorance about homosexuals and their treatment.
3. The lack of knowledge about gay issues threatens the patchwork of legal protection for homosexuals at the local, state, and national levels.
4. In Florida, there is a growing effort to repeal existing gay rights laws and prevent new ones from being enacted through ballot initiatives.
5. Some jurisdictions are repealing their gay rights ordinances, while others are proposing measures to prohibit the enactment of new ones.
6. Gay rights groups are planning educational campaigns to show that homosexuals have many of the same concerns as those opposing gay rights laws.
7. The study by professors at the University of Florida found that few claims had been filed under existing gay rights ordinances, partly because many gay men and women are reluctant to reveal their sexual orientation publicly.

Overall, the trend suggests a significant backlash against progress made in securing legal protections for homosexuals, with religious conservatives playing a key role in driving the anti-gay rights initiatives."

9412070,731090,"What an intriguing article! As David Brion Davis, a Jewish professor from Yale, I must say that I'm intrigued by the notion that my planned lecture at Howard University might draw protests from some students due to my religion.

It seems that Howard University is facing quite a few challenges, including budget deficits, layoffs, and controversies surrounding the management of its funds. The article highlights the university's difficulties in attracting students, with enrollment numbers declining over the years. Additionally, there are concerns about the physical state of the campus, which has led to safety issues such as fire code violations.

As an outsider looking in, I can't help but feel a sense of empathy for the Howard community. It's clear that the university is going through a tumultuous time, and it's not hard to imagine why students might be frustrated with the administration.

However, I must say that I'm also intrigued by the resilience and determination of the Howard faculty and students. Despite the challenges they're facing, there seems to be a strong sense of community and commitment to preserving the university as a black institution.

As someone who values free speech and open dialogue, I'm particularly interested in the administration's efforts to enhance financial stability while also promoting the ideal of free expression on campus.

9412075,731285,"The article discusses a lawsuit filed against tobacco companies by smokers claiming they were addicted to nicotine and suffered from tobacco-related ailments. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status, which would allow thousands of people to join together in the lawsuit.

According to the article, if the judge agrees to certify the class, it would be the nation's largest mass lawsuit. The tobacco industry has never had to pay any monetary penalties in a court of law before. The lawsuit accuses the tobacco companies of negligence, fraud and deceit for concealing knowledge that nicotine is addictive and manipulating the levels of nicotine in cigarettes to keep customers addicted.

The article quotes Phillip A. Wittman, who presented arguments for the tobacco companies, saying that the judge's decision was an encouragement to their side. On the other hand, John P. Coale, one of the smokers' lawyers, said they were also encouraged by the judge's request for a trial plan.

The hearing was closely followed by investors and Wall Street analysts, some of whom observed the proceedings from the courtroom packed with 130 observers, including lawyers and reporters. The potential liability for cigarette manufacturers is estimated at $100 billion, which is larger than the combined market capitalization of the major tobacco companies.

Overall, the article suggests that the lawsuit has the potential to be a significant challenge to the tobacco industry, but it's not clear whether the judge will certify the class-action status or how the trial would proceed if certified."

The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities favors either turning General Assistance over to the state or reimbursing all local costs, but instead, takeover has been put off and reimbursements have been cut.

The article also mentions the A Fair Chance program, which aims to remove obstacles that prevent people from becoming independent. Welfare recipients who work are allowed to keep more of their income, and education, job training, and opportunities for child care are being expanded.

Additionally, the article highlights two pilot projects: Pathways, which places a two-year limit on benefits for randomly selected A.F.D.C. recipients in New Haven and Manchester; and Family Strength, which provides an increase in the limit on A.F.D.C. clients' assets from $1,000 to $3,000.

The city of Bridgeport has also implemented its own program, offering job training for welfare clients and placing more than 800 able-bodied clients into permanent jobs. The city provides transportation to work for about 60 days and offers individual attention to spot problems such as alcoholism or day care issues.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for accountability in the General Assistance system and the importance of providing support and training to help recipients become independent."

1. Vigiling (silent protest holding placards, banners): Although there is no mention of actual protesting or demonstrating in the article, it does mention neighbors having a chance to see new plans and express concerns about the development.

20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing: This activity matches the description of neighbors expressing concerns about the development by holding signs and discussing issues with city officials.

28. Sloganeering/chanting (chanting same small sets of words): There is no direct evidence of sloganeering or chanting in the article, but it does mention that ""residents of the area are a tad nervous"" which implies some level of collective concern or protest.

41. Polling (report of polling attitudes regarding social movement claim): Although there is no direct mention of polling or surveying opinions in the article, it does report on the concerns and worries expressed by neighbors about the development, implying that opinions are being collected and reported."

9412098,732359,"This article reports on an unusual decision by corporate Wal-Mart to keep open a small store in Bridge City, Louisiana, despite plans to replace it with a larger Supercenter nearby. The company's executives met with local residents, including two mothers who had organized a campaign to save the store.

The women, Mrs. Mitchell and Mrs. Meeks, were able to present their concerns and arguments directly to Bill Fields, the president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Mrs. Mitchell highlighted the founder's emphasis on ""thinking small"" and his concern about the ""big disease,"" which resonated with the executives.

As a result, Wal-Mart officials announced that they would rescind the planned closing, making it the first time in the company's 32-year history that this had happened. The decision was met with celebration in Bridge City, where residents have praised the small store for its personalized service and community involvement.

The article notes that while some towns have resisted the arrival of Wal-Mart due to concerns about the chain's impact on local businesses and the community, Bridge City has been more welcoming. The town relies heavily on sales tax revenue from the Wal-Mart store, which provides a significant portion of the town's income.

Wal-Mart executives emphasized that the decision was made in response to customer feedback and a desire to understand and address concerns about the planned closure. The company also highlighted the benefits of the new Supercenter, including its larger size and greater selection of products.

Overall, this incident appears to be an example of how corporate Wal-Mart is willing to listen to and respond to customer concerns, even if it means making an unusual decision that goes against the usual trend of consolidating smaller stores into larger ones."

* The Mayor wanted Cortines to agree to performance goals set by him, but Cortines refused, saying he needed more time to implement his agenda.
* The board voted 5-2 to extend Cortines' contract through June 30, 1997, despite the Mayor's opposition.

9412113,732929,"The article reports on a hearing in Gloucester County, New Jersey, where public defenders are seeking to suppress evidence seized during arrests made by state troopers on the turnpike. The defense claims that racial profiling is being used by the troopers to target black drivers and stop their vehicles for searches.

Two former state troopers, both black, testified that they were taught to use racial profiles to stop drivers and pressure them to let their cars be searched. One of the former troopers, Kenneth Wilson, claimed that he was coached by superiors in ""trickery"" during patrols to stop young black men driving cars with out-of-state plates and get them to consent to a search.

The defense also presented experts and surveys showing that race had to influence the selection of cars that state troopers decided to stop. According to the data, 73% of arrests made by the state police at this end of the turnpike were black, while only 13.5% of all turnpike traffic is comprised of black occupants.

The state police deny the existence of racial profiling and claim that it's a national leader in carrying out racial and ethnic sensitivity programs for recruits and veterans on the force. They also argue that the defendants in these cases face serious charges and that attempts to suppress evidence based on allegations of racial profiling have been rejected by the courts in other counties.

The hearing is ongoing, with the defense expected to complete their arguments this week. The state will then present its case to preserve the evidence, and a ruling may not be made until after January 1."

9412120,733119,"This article is about the 1987 NFL players' strike and the use of replacement players during that time. The strike was canceled after three weeks, but not before the replacement games became a reality.

Here are some key points extracted from the article:

1. The strike started on September 28, 1987, due to owners' unwillingness to include free agency in collective bargaining agreement negotiations.
2. Replacement players were used for three weeks, featuring college professors, truck drivers, and prison guards instead of Pro Bowl players.
3. The use of replacement players led to inconsistent games, with some teams struggling more than others (e.g., Giants loaded their team with semipro players).
4. Some notable players crossed the picket line and played with replacement players, including Lawrence Taylor and Reggie Williams.
5. The strike ultimately ended with the owners and players reaching a new collective bargaining agreement.

In terms of parallels to the current situation in baseball, the article highlights:

1. The potential for replacement players to be used if an agreement is not reached between owners and players.
2. The differing levels of fan interest and attendance during the NFL strike (football games continued as scheduled) compared to baseball (the sport's slower pace and fewer games might lead to a different response from fans).

Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the 1987 NFL players' strike and its implications for professional sports."
9412125,733249,"Here are some key points about David Thorp's protest against the economic situation in Connecticut:

1. **Leaving Connecticut**: After 7 consecutive terms as a member of the General Assembly, Thorp decided to leave Connecticut due to the state's poor economy and his own struggles finding employment.
2. **Age discrimination**: Thorp was laid off from Pratt & Whitney after 16 years of teaching computer science, citing age discrimination. He and others who were also laid off have filed a lawsuit against the company.
3. **Critique of education system**: Thorp believes that Connecticut's educational enhancement act of the late 1980s was a ""dreadful mistake"" that has failed to improve student outcomes. He suggests that the high salaries for teachers and administrators have driven up municipal costs, contributing to the state's economic woes.
4. **Opposition to income tax**: Thorp voted against the state income tax on a technicality, citing the lack of spending limitations. He believes that Connecticut should not be giving away millions of dollars in economic aid packages to attract businesses to the state.
5. **Critique of government spending**: Thorp thinks that Connecticut has too many municipalities (169 towns) and that this contributes to high costs and inefficiencies. He suggests consolidating governments or creating regional authorities to reduce costs.
6. **Leaving behind a legacy**: Despite his criticisms, Thorp acknowledges that he could have been more effective in his role as a state representative. He hopes that his experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for others.

Overall, David Thorp's protest is centered around his belief that Connecticut's economic woes are the result of poor policy decisions and inefficiencies, particularly in the education system."
9412124,733250,"This is not about celebration, but rather a vigil for people who have lost loved ones due to drunk driving. The event was sponsored by MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and to honor those who have been affected by it.

The vigil included lighting candles for individuals who had died as a result of drunk driving, including Michael Tesler, Edward Farrell, and others. The families of these victims shared stories and memories of their loved ones, highlighting the devastating impact that drunk driving can have on families and communities.

The event also highlighted MADD's efforts to reduce drunk driving through education, advocacy, and enforcement. This included supporting legislation that would lower the legal limit for intoxication and prohibiting any alcohol in the body for drivers under age 21.

Overall, the vigil was a poignant reminder of the human cost of drunk driving and the importance of working together to prevent such tragedies from occurring."

9412128,733521,"What a great article! It's clear that the fight over Exxon's proposed mine is a deeply contentious issue in northern Wisconsin, with passionate arguments on both sides.

On one hand, Exxon and its supporters argue that the mine would bring much-needed jobs and economic growth to the area. They also claim that modern mining technology can prevent environmental damage, including pollution of streams and lakes.

On the other hand, the Sokaogon Chippewa tribe and their allies are vehemently opposed to the mine, citing concerns about the potential harm it could cause to their way of life. They argue that the mine would ruin a delicate ecosystem and threaten the tribe's traditional practices, including hunting and gathering for wild rice.

The article highlights some of the key tensions in this dispute, including the conflicting views on environmental risk and the importance of preserving natural resources. It also notes that Exxon has spent millions on studies to prove its claims about the mine's safety, while the Chippewa tribe has hired experts to evaluate the project and raise concerns about pollution.

One of the most striking aspects of this story is the strong emotional investment in both sides. For example, Frances Van Zile, the tribe's chief records clerk, says that the proposed mine would destroy their way of life, while Mayor Vern Kincaid of Crandon suggests that a well-run mine could be a boon for young people seeking employment.

Overall, this article presents a nuanced and balanced view of a complex issue. It highlights the deep divisions between different stakeholders and raises important questions about the role of environmentalism in tribal communities."
9412132,733750,"The article highlights the struggles faced by tenants and landlords in New York City's housing courts, specifically in Brooklyn's housing court. The court system is plagued by inefficiencies, biases, and a lack of respect for judges. Here are some key points extracted from the article:

1. **Tenant as prey**: Tenants are often seen as prey by lawyers and judges, who may take advantage of their lack of knowledge about the legal system.
2. **Landlord's plight**: Landlords also face difficulties in collecting rent and dealing with tenants who rely on public assistance for rent.
3. **Court inefficiencies**: The court system is criticized for its slow pace, with cases taking years to resolve. This can lead to financial losses for both landlords and tenants.
4. **Judge's role**: Housing court judges play a crucial role in mediating disputes and translating the law for litigants without lawyers.
5. **Lack of respect**: Judges in housing courts often receive little respect from lawyers, litigants, or even other judges.
6. **Bias allegations**: A class-action suit filed in Federal court alleges that the system is biased against property owners.
7. **Repair cases**: Only a rare few tenants press repair cases, as they may see it as a luxury rather than a necessity.
8. **Systemic issues**: The article suggests that systemic issues, such as inadequate funding and poor management, contribute to the inefficiencies in the housing court system.

Overall, the article paints a picture of a complex, often dysfunctional system that needs significant reform to better serve the needs of both tenants and landlords."
9501001,734522,"This article reports on the killings of two receptionists at abortion clinics in Boston and Norfolk, Virginia, and the reaction from pro-life leaders. Despite some moderate leaders distancing themselves from endorsing violence, radical proponents continued to promote a culture of violence and intimidation.

The article highlights quotes from extreme anti-abortion leaders, including Daniel Ware, who warned that ""blood will run in the streets like nobody has ever seen"" if an abortion doctor is executed, and Rev. David Trosch, who predicted ""massive killing of abortionists and their staffs."" The suspect in the attacks, John Salvi III, is not directly linked to any anti-abortion groups.

The article also mentions a manual for anti-abortion activists called ""The Army of God,"" which advocates for violence against abortion providers. A study by the Fund for the Feminist Majority found that extremists were increasingly using death threats as their primary tactic in the battle against abortion.

Some pro-life leaders, such as Rev. Pat Mahoney and James Foley, expressed concern about the impact of violent rhetoric on society and the need to re-evaluate their approach. However, others continued to promote a culture of violence and intimidation.

The article concludes by noting that the killings have led to increased scrutiny of anti-abortion language and tactics, with some calling for limits on the right to call for ""justifiable homicide."""
9501002,734591,"Based on this news article, here are some key points about the Norfolk abortion clinic shooting:

* The suspect, John Salvi, is being held in the city jail and has been talking to police since his arrest.
* He has refused to talk to reporters and does not yet have a lawyer.
* Police officials and anti-abortion groups have said that Salvi was not known as a prominent figure in any anti-abortion group.
* New Hampshire authorities found anti-abortion literature in his home, but it is unclear if he received information or assistance from local abortion opponents.
* The clinic has been a target of protests since it opened in 1973 and has had previous incidents of violence, including a fire set by an intruder in 1983 and a pipe bomb exploding nearby in 1984.

Additionally, the article highlights some controversial statements made by militant anti-abortion proponents, such as Rev. Donald R. Spitz and David J. Crane, who argue that the violence was understandable or even justifiable in order to ""save the babies"" from abortion. However, other opponents of abortion have condemned the killings, with one pastor stating that peaceful protests are necessary to advance their cause."
9501003,734868,"The article describes a series of violent incidents at abortion clinics in Brookline, Massachusetts, perpetrated by anti-abortion activists from Operation Rescue. The most recent incident occurred when a lone gunman shot up two clinics, killing two receptionists and wounding five people.

Prior to this incident, Operation Rescue had been known for its disruptive tactics, including blocking clinic entrances and chaining themselves together. The police department in Brookline had worked to keep the clinics safe and open, despite these challenges.

The article also notes that the town's liberal reputation and the strong support for women's reproductive rights among local officials and residents contributed to a hostile attitude towards Operation Rescue.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* Lieutenant McDermott, 46 years old with 26 years on the force: ""I'm pro-law. Those two clinics are not abortion mills. They're women's health care centers.""
* Philip Lawler, spokesman for Operation Rescue Boston: ""We had less cooperation in Brookline. They had a very hostile attitude.""

The article also mentions that John C. Salvi III, the suspect in the clinic killings, does not appear to be affiliated with Operation Rescue.

Overall, the article highlights the tensions and violence surrounding abortion clinics in the 1990s, particularly in Brookline, Massachusetts, where the police department worked to keep the clinics safe and open despite opposition from anti-abortion activists."

9501016,736420,"This news article discusses the case of Missouri v. Jenkins, a court case regarding desegregation in schools. The state of Missouri has spent over $800 million to desegregate schools, but student achievement has not improved substantially. The state's lawyer argues that the state's constitutional duty is fulfilled if it complies with court orders and does all it can to ensure non-discriminatory resource allocation and student assignments.

However, several justices disagree, pointing out that the state's argument ignores the fact that the desegregation plan has not led to substantial improvements in student achievement. Justice Souter asks why it is irrelevant to consider whether the educational offerings are having an effect, while Justice Breyer questions whether the state can't look at whether students are reading or achieving other basic skills.

The debate highlights the range of attitudes among the justices on this issue, with some seeing the case as primarily about compliance with court orders and others recognizing the need to consider student achievement. The article suggests that the court may be inclined to rule broadly that the lower courts had gone too far in requiring Missouri to continue spending money on desegregation efforts, but there is also uncertainty about whether this case raises broad issues at all.

Protest-related information extracted:

* Cost: $800 million (repairs) and $1.3 billion (total spent so far)

The same article mentions that some signs read ""You risk injury or death if you are caught on or near these premises"" - This could be seen as a form of warning or threat (Activity 27: Speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on).
4. The article mentions that authorities are investigating whether there is a connection between the note and the threatening signs posted over the weekend - This suggests that the protest activities may be connected, but I couldn't find any specific activity mentioned in the article to code under (Activity 98: Other activity)."
9501017,736572,"Based on the article, I code up to 4 protest activities:

1; 20; 21; 27.

Here's my reasoning:

* The first activity is not explicitly mentioned as a protest activity, but it seems like Judge Henderson's ruling and findings are a form of protest against the abuses at Pelican Bay State Prison.
* The second activity is holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing (code 20). Although there isn't an explicit mention of holding signs or banners in the article, it can be inferred that the lawyers and advocates for the inmates are using this method to protest against the abuses.
* The third activity is praying (code 21). There's no explicit mention of praying in the article, but it can be inferred that some people might use prayer as a form of spiritual protest or to express solidarity with the inmates who are affected by the abuses.
* The fourth activity is speechmaking (code 27). Although there isn't an explicit mention of speechmaking in the article, it can be inferred that lawyers and advocates for the inmates are using speeches or testimony to highlight the issues and abuses at Pelican Bay State Prison."

1 ; 20; 26; 32

Explanation:
1. Bannering: The Ku Klux Klan wanted to erect a 10-foot cross as a Christmas display in December 1993, which can be considered bannering.
2. Holding signs/picketing: Although not explicitly mentioned, the fact that the Klan sought permission to display their cross and were refused can be seen as holding signs or picketing for their cause.
3. Silence: The article mentions that Judge James L. Graham said that the display would mean only that ""the reasonable observer should conclude that the Government is expressing its toleration of religious and secular pluralism."" This implies a silent protest or vigil, hence code 26.
4. Wreathing: Although not explicitly mentioned, the idea of laying wreaths or floral arrangements on statues or memorials can be seen as analogous to this activity, hence code 32."

9501033,739021,"**MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT**

To: The Honorable [Judge's Name]

From: [Your Name], Counsel for Plaintiff Christine McKennon

Re: Defendant Nashville Banner, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment

Plaintiff Christine McKennon respectfully submits that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be denied. Despite the Defendant's concession that age discrimination was the real reason for Ms. McKennon's termination, the Defendant seeks to frustrate the purpose of the Federal laws against discrimination by invoking after-acquired evidence of Ms. McKennon's wrongdoing.

The Supreme Court's recent decision in McKennon v. Nashville Banner, Inc. (1996) clarifies that an employer cannot use after-acquired evidence as a defense to defeat an employee's claim of discriminatory termination. The Court held that the employer's motive is what matters for determining whether discrimination occurred, and that an employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account in fashioning a remedy.

In this case, the Defendant has conceded that age discrimination was the real reason for Ms. McKennon's termination. Therefore, the Defendant cannot claim that Ms. McKennon was fired for a non-discriminatory reason. The Court should not allow the Defendant to use after-acquired evidence of Ms. McKennon's wrongdoing as a defense to defeat her claim.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decision in McKennon v. Nashville Banner, Inc. (1996) provides that back pay is an appropriate remedy from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered. The Defendant cannot claim that Ms. McKennon would have been terminated on the grounds of her wrongdoing alone if they had known about it at the time of her termination.

In conclusion, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be denied. The Court should not allow the Defendant to use after-acquired evidence as a defense to defeat Ms. McKennon's claim of discriminatory termination. Instead, the Court should focus on the Employer's motive and fashion an appropriate remedy for Ms. McKennon's unlawful discharge.

* The dispute is over shellfish harvesting rights in Puget Sound, Washington.
* The Indians are claiming treaty rights to harvest 50% of the shellfish in Puget Sound, citing a clause in a treaty signed by Chief Seattle and Governor Isaac Stevens in 1855.
* The property owners, including commercial oyster growers and private landowners, are opposed to the Indian's claims, fearing that it will devastate their industry and lead to vandalism and threats to their lives.
* Gunshots were fired over the heads of Indians who were digging clams on a beach on the Olympic Peninsula two weeks ago, sparking concerns about escalating tensions between the two groups.
* The dispute has been ongoing for decades, with court rulings in favor of the Indians. The latest ruling by Judge Edward Rafeedie extends previous decisions to include shellfish harvesting rights.
* Both sides are appealing the decision, with the property owners hoping to overturn the earlier Boldt decision on salmon harvesting rights at the Supreme Court level.

**Protest Location:** Livingston, New Jersey
**Reason for Protest:** Proposed cuts in school aid by Governor Christine Whitman, which would affect primarily wealthy school systems, including Livingston's.

**Key Protesting Groups:**

1. Parents and educators in Livingston
2. The Garden State Coalition of Schools (a group of suburban school districts)

**Protest Highlights:**

* Residents and parents at a meeting expressed deep disappointment and anger over the proposed cuts.
* School officials and residents questioned why administrative costs, such as outlays for nurses, librarians, guidance counselors, and libraries, were being counted as excess spending.
* Some lawmakers are calling for hearings on the proposal and hinting that the reductions should be delayed for six months or a year.

**Quotes from Protesters:**

* ""This is going to hurt her popularity... People who voted for her and had faith in what she was going to do are very saddened by what her actual approach to saving money is."" - Molly Emiliani, vice president of the Livingston Parent-Teacher Council
* ""We really didn't know about this any more than everyone else."" - Assemblywoman Maureen Ogden (R)
* ""Don't think that we are going to be fooled now by Governor Whitman trying to convince us that nurses and librarians are administrators."" - Stephen Friedman, 45, an epidemiologist who has two children in the Livingston schools.

**Key Figures:**

1. Christine Whitman, Governor of New Jersey
2. Leo Klagholz, State Education Commissioner under Governor Whitman
3. Robert Kish, School Superintendent of Livingston
4. Maureen Ogden (R), Assemblywoman representing Livingston

This protest highlights a contentious issue in the state of New Jersey: school funding and aid cuts. The proposed cuts by Governor Whitman have sparked outrage among parents, educators, and lawmakers, who are concerned about the impact on local schools and communities."
9502011,741878,"This article reports on the increase in racial violence in Los Angeles County jails, particularly between Hispanic and black inmates. According to officials, a major brawl at another county jail a year ago contributed to a 56% reduction in violence since then.

The most violent prisoners are housed in solitary confinement cells where they can be constantly observed through glass shields. When taken out for bathing, they are kept in chains. Captain Al Scaduto, the warden of Men's Central Jail, described some inmates as ""like scorpions"" who will attack anyone at any time.

Racial tensions have risen in recent years, and many incidents in the jails have a racial element, according to Darrell Bryan, executive editor of Corrections Compendium. Hispanic inmates feel continuing anger over televised images of the 1992 riots after the Rodney King case verdict.

The article highlights the demographics of the Los Angeles jails, where poor black and Hispanic immigrants are competing for jobs and housing, leading to racial tensions that echo in schools and gang clashes on the streets. With a 70% recidivism rate in the county's jails, the violence of the streets and lockup begins to meld, and the walls and bars of the jails seem increasingly insubstantial.

The article also mentions the flexing of muscles by a Hispanic prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia or ""la M,"" which has ordered a halt to drive-by shootings among Hispanic gangs and threatened to enforce it with retribution against gang members now in jail. The prison gang may be attempting to control the violence so that it can challenge black gangs for portions of the drug trade, experts say.

The article concludes by stating that the racial tensions in the jails reflect the demographics of the city and the problems of society at large, and that officials are responding with heightened vigilance."

9502003,743699,"This article discusses the protests at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, against university president Richard Lawrence, who made statements suggesting that black students fared poorly on college admissions tests due to their ""genetic hereditary background."" The article focuses on several student leaders, including Mr. Rosa, a senior and member of the United Student Coalition (USC), which was formed in response to Lawrence's comments.

These student leaders are from diverse backgrounds, including African American, Hispanic, Italian, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Haitian. They share experiences of growing up in predominantly minority neighborhoods or cities, attending public schools with diverse student bodies, and facing challenges adjusting to the predominantly white Rutgers University environment.

The article highlights the passions and contradictions of youth, as these students condemn political leaders but may not bother to vote; value self-determination but are intolerant of dissent from other black or Hispanic students; and struggle to raise the discussion above the level of black versus white.

Some key points from the article:

1. The USC is a coalition of 27 student organizations, including nearly every black and Hispanic group on campus.
2. The leaders of these groups say their job is to keep students informed and actively oppose Lawrence's statements.
3. Some coalition members are children of middle-class professionals, while others are first-generation college attendees or grew up in the suburbs with predominantly white families.
4. Many of these students have been active in campus politics since freshman year and were already protesting tuition increases in 1993.
5. The tensions between students and administrators over issues like department financing had lingered, creating an environment that was primed for conflict.

Overall, this article highlights the diverse perspectives and experiences of student leaders who are driving the protests at Rutgers University against President Lawrence's comments."
9502029,744125,"This news article reports on a gathering of Holocaust survivors and their descendants at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel in Miami Beach. The event aims to celebrate the survivors' accomplishments and legacy, particularly their descendants. Many of the survivors are now in their 70s and 80s, and they have shared their stories through oral histories.

The article highlights the significance of this gathering, as it brings together people who were once forced into camps and ghettos during World War II. The event also serves as a reminder that the living memory of the Holocaust is fading, with only about 70,000 survivors remaining in the United States.

The article features several personal stories from the survivors, including Dr. Nitzberg, a hematologist who lost his parents and six siblings in the camps. He attributes his professional success to his experience in the Holocaust, motivating his children by example and by lessons drawn from his experiences.

The gathering also includes reunions of friends and relatives at a ""survivors village"" in a ballroom, where computers allow for tracing names and pictures from a survivors registry. The event also features the presentation of flags of liberating United States Army units and a videotaped address by President Clinton.

9502032,744179,"The article discusses the asbestos-related health issues affecting New Jersey residents who worked for Johns Manville Company and other asbestos manufacturers with headquarters in the state. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982, and four years later, two independent entities emerged: the Manville Corporation and the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.

The trust was created to settle personal injury claims related to asbestos exposure, but by 1990, the number of claims had risen to 100,000, raising concerns that the trust's assets would be depleted rapidly. As a result, a federal court judge ordered all payments by the trust to be halted until a restructuring plan was approved in December.

The article also mentions two other asbestos manufacturers with New Jersey headquarters: Baldwin-Ehret-Hill and Ruberoid. Both companies have settled or litigated numerous personal injury claims related to asbestos exposure.

The consequences of the asbestos mess are felt daily by thousands of New Jersey households, as men and women who worked for these companies or used asbestos products develop health problems. The article highlights the stories of two Manville residents, Thaddeus Kowalski and Robert G. McCann, who have both developed asbestos-related illnesses and have received settlements from Johns Manville Company.

The article also notes that Keene Corporation, which acquired Baldwin-Ehret-Hill in 1968, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 1993. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy within three to six months and may create a trust to administer the settlement of asbestos claims.

The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing struggles faced by those affected by asbestos exposure, including concerns about health insurance and the slow pace of compensation claims."

9502041,745661,"This article discusses the phenomenon of ""reverse sexual harassment"" where women in positions of power are engaging in behaviors that are similar to those exhibited by men in the past, while men are feeling frustrated and angry about it. The article highlights several examples of this trend, including a lawsuit filed by eight male weight-loss counselors against Jenny Craig International, where they claim they were subjected to sexist behavior and harassment.

The article also explores the idea that women who have achieved power and status may exhibit behaviors similar to those exhibited by men in the past, such as making sexual remarks or excluding others based on their gender. This phenomenon is referred to as ""power-based"" rather than ""gender-based"" harassment.

Experts quoted in the article suggest that this trend is not necessarily a reversal of previous power dynamics, but rather an acknowledgment that power and authority can be abused regardless of one's gender. They also caution that women who have achieved power must be held to the same standards as men, and that training programs should focus on teaching decision-makers how to respect others' differences.

Some experts argue that sexual remarks directed at men are less malevolent than similar comments directed at women, while others suggest that ""girl talk"" may not necessarily be a major career impediment for men. However, all agree that derogatory stereotypes and exclusionary behavior can create a hostile working environment.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities of power dynamics in the workplace and the need for training programs to address issues of bias and harassment regardless of gender."

However, the prosecution presented a different scenario through their witness, Dr. Michael Baden, who testified that Mrs. Pyne's claims of self-defense were unfounded. According to Dr. Baden, Mr. Pyne was already paralyzed from the first bullet wound before the subsequent shots were fired.

Wallace, who was once a fierce opponent of integration and civil rights, has since apologized for his actions and sought to make amends.

The article describes how Wallace, now 75 and confined to a wheelchair due to a 1972 assassination attempt, did not deliver a speech himself but instead had an aide read his remarks. In the speech, Wallace welcomed the marchers to Montgomery and acknowledged the progress that has been made since the civil rights era.

While some of the marchers were skeptical about Wallace's motives and felt that he was seeking forgiveness from God rather than making amends with those who suffered at the hands of his policies, others were more forgiving. The article quotes Joseph E. Lowery, a civil rights leader, as saying, ""Thank you for coming out of your sickness to meet us... You are a different George Wallace today.""

9503023,748574,"The lawsuit brought by six active-duty and reserve service members in New York claims that the military's new policy on gay service members violates their First Amendment rights. The policy, which allows gay men and lesbians to serve as long as they keep their sexual orientation private, has been criticized by some as a ""charade"" that does not truly allow for open service.

Despite the Pentagon's aggressive education campaign, some commanders have reportedly abused or misunderstood the new rules, leading to instances of harassment and discrimination against gay service members. The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a military legal-aid organization, has cited 180 cases in the last year where they say commanders violated the policy.

However, there are also examples of gay service members serving openly without incident. For instance, Capt. Rich Richenberg, an electronic warfare officer at Offutt Air Force Base, told his commanders he was gay nearly two years ago and has received broad support from his colleagues.

The experience in the field is proving to be more complicated than either side's depiction might suggest. While some commanders have been accommodating, others have been less so, leading to instances of harassment and discrimination.

Senior Pentagon officials acknowledge that individual commanders vary in how aggressively they enforce the new policy, which can set the climate toward homosexuals serving in the office or command.

1 ; 20 ; 21 ; 28

Explanation:
1. Meeting Disruption (Meeting candidates) - Although not explicitly mentioned in the article, it can be inferred that there is tension and disagreement between SUNY trustees and Senate Republicans, which could be considered a form of meeting disruption.

20. Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The article mentions protests against the proposed budget cuts, including ""devastation"" for campuses and hospitals if certain measures are implemented. This suggests that some individuals or groups may have held signs or engaged in other forms of peaceful protest.

21. Praying - There is no explicit mention of praying or religious services in the article, but it's possible that some individuals or groups may have held prayer vigils or other religious ceremonies to express their concerns about the proposed budget cuts.

28. It's impossible to say whether any closings will happen: despite increasingly rocky relations between SUNY trustees and Senate Republicans, even Senate leaders have said they expect some softening of what would be the largest single cut in SUNY history - This could be interpreted as a form of protest or opposition to the proposed budget cuts.

9503038,750117,"This article discusses Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential campaign, particularly his speech in New Hampshire. Some key points include:

1. Buchanan vowed to lead a ""cultural war"" against what he saw as a corrupt and immoral society, citing the need to ""chase the purveyors of sex and violence back beneath the rocks whence they came.""
2. He emphasized his opposition to abortion, affirmative action, and what he called ""quota bills,"" which were seen as threats to traditional American values.
3. Buchanan also pledged to eliminate foreign aid and reduce the influence of foreign lobbyists in Washington.
4. His campaign was viewed by many as a protest candidacy, with some seeing him as a conservative alternative to more mainstream Republicans like Senator Phil Gramm.
5. Despite his low polling numbers, Buchanan's presence in the race was expected to have an impact on the Republican contest, particularly in early primary states like New Hampshire.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""We shall remind them: the Buchanan Brigades are not leap-year conservatives.""
* ""I will use the bully pulpit of the Presidency of the United States, to the full extent of my powers and ability, to defend American traditions and the values of faith, family and country from any and all directions.""
* ""In a Buchanan White House, foreign lobbyists and corporate contributors will not sit at the head of the table. I will.""

The article also mentions that Buchanan's campaign was marred by an incident in which four protesters jumped onto the podium during his speech, waving signs with anti-Buchanan slogans."

Here are the key points:

**Protest:** About 1,000 Nicaraguans gathered in front of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) offices in Miami to protest new rules denying applicants for political asylum work permits while their cases are pending.

**Background:** The change aims to cut down on fraudulent claims and help clear a backlog of asylum cases. However, it threatens the livelihoods of thousands of exiles, forcing them either to take illegal jobs or leave the country.

**Impact:** The new rules will affect approximately 24,000 Nicaraguans whose applications for asylum have yet to be resolved, as well as thousands more who are appealing their cases.

**Concerns:** Many protesters feel caught between a recovering Nicaragua that says it cannot yet absorb them and an adopted United States that has never given them a blanket welcome. They fear being forced to return to Nicaragua without certainty about their futures or the ability to start over in their native country.

* The House of Representatives voted on a welfare overhaul bill that aimed to reduce out-of-wedlock births and reform the welfare system.
* The debate was intense, with Democrats portraying Republicans as cruel, inhumane, and immoral for allegedly throwing children into the streets to finance tax cuts for wealthy people.
* Republicans countered by arguing that the current welfare system perpetuated poverty and trapped people in a cycle of dependency.
* The bill included provisions that would deny cash assistance to unmarried teen-agers under 18 years old and prohibit extra assistance for additional babies born to mothers already receiving welfare.
* The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Roman Catholic Church opposed the bill, arguing that it would encourage abortions and coerce women into making reproductive choices.
* Some Republicans, including prominent conservatives, voted against the rule on the welfare bill due to concerns about amendments not being allowed or the bill's provisions not addressing their concerns.
* The vote splintered the conservative coalition that had controlled the House for 11 weeks.

The protests and criticisms expressed by various groups and lawmakers include:

* Democrats' relentless portrayal of Republicans as cruel, inhumane, and immoral.
* Roman Catholic bishops' opposition to the bill due to its alleged encouragement of abortions.
* The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League's and NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund's concerns about coercion and reproductive choice.
* Republican opponents' criticism that the bill did not permit them to offer all necessary amendments.
* Black lawmakers' harsh criticism, including Representative William L. Clay's comparison of the bill's provisions to castration or sterilization.

9504009,753671,"A fascinating article! It appears that a lawsuit filed by the Otero County Commission, represented by the Howard Foundation, is seeking to challenge the federal government's ownership and management of public lands in New Mexico. The suit argues that the equal footing clause of the US Constitution grants new states entering the union the same powers and authorities as the original 13 states, which would effectively transfer control of these public lands from the federal government to the state.

The lawsuit is seen as a significant challenge to the long-standing practice of federal land ownership and management in the West. If successful, it could lead to a major shift in the way these public lands are managed, with local governments and private interests potentially gaining more control over their use and development.

Conservationists, on the other hand, view this lawsuit as an attempt by well-financed interest groups to undermine environmental protections and exploit federal subsidies for personal gain. They argue that the public lands at issue are a shared resource, not the domain of individual ranchers or loggers.

It's interesting to note that the Howard Foundation is also representing Nye County, Nevada, in a similar lawsuit, which has already led to a counter-suit by the Justice Department. This legal battle is likely to continue for some time, with significant implications for the management and use of public lands in the Western United States.

In summary, this article highlights the controversy surrounding the ownership and management of public lands in New Mexico, with local interests seeking to challenge federal control and conservationists advocating for environmental protections."

9504017,754931,"Here is the protest information extracted from the news article:

**Protest Topic:** Color-blind adoption policies and the debate over interracial adoptions.

**Key Players:**

* Ms. Mullens, a social worker who is part of an unlikely coalition pushing for color-blind adoption policies.
* Matthew and Joseph, two black brothers who are being adopted by Ms. Mullens' family.
* Laurence H. Tribe and Randall Kennedy, law professors at Harvard University who are supporting the Mullens' case against race matching in adoption.
* Clint Bolick, head of the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that is challenging racial-preference policies.

**Protest Arguments:**

* Opponents of color-blind adoption policies argue that social workers are using race-matching laws to keep black children in foster care while searching for black families willing or able to adopt.
* Critics say these policies are ""seriously harmful"" to black children and delay the adoption process, causing harm to the child.
* Proponents of color-blind adoption policies argue that there is no evidence that transracial adoption does any harm compared to same-race adoption.
* Some black conservatives argue that adopting children of the same race is necessary to help them maintain a sense of racial identity.

**Protest Tensions:**

* The debate over interracial adoptions has united some old enemies, including liberals and conservatives who are normally at odds with each other.
* There is a tension between those who believe that race should not be a factor in adoption decisions and those who believe that adopting children of the same race is necessary to preserve their cultural identities.

**Protest Goals:**

* The Mullens want to have race matching in adoption declared unconstitutional.
* Proponents of color-blind adoption policies want to see a shift away from race-matching laws and towards a system where children are placed with families based on other factors, such as the child's needs and the family's qualifications."
9504016,754934,"The nation's first law promoting voluntary integration across an entire state was the subject of a recent court decision in Connecticut. The ruling, which was met with surprise and frustration by civil rights advocates, refused to order busing across town lines to achieve racial balance in schools.

The case, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, involved 17 white and minority schoolchildren who argued that the intense poverty and racial isolation in Hartford's schools denied them an equal educational opportunity compared to surrounding suburbs. The plaintiffs presented proof of the harm through standardized tests designed by and required by the State Department of Education, which showed that Hartford children repeatedly ranked last and their scores were falling.

However, Judge Harry Hammer of Superior Court refused to consider the civil rights lawyers' arguments that the state was responsible for the conditions in Hartford's schools. Instead, he found that the concentration of minority children in Hartford schools resulted from housing patterns across the state, which produced cities that consisted mostly of minority groups and suburbs that were overwhelmingly white.

The judge approvingly quoted a 1972 Supreme Court decision, Spencer v. Kugler, which stated that ""racially balanced municipalities are beyond the pale of either judicial or legislative intervention."" The decision was seen as a blow to civil rights advocates who had hoped for a ruling that would require action to address the severe inequalities in Hartford's schools.

The case will now be appealed to the State Supreme Court, where lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to argue that Judge Hammer erred in finding that the state had no obligation to correct the conditions in Hartford because it was not to blame for them."

2. The rally organizers are urging followers to come to New York and ""take part in spiritual warfare"" which indicates speechmaking (27) is involved.
3. The article mentions a plan to demonstrate how to protest peacefully, which might involve parading chariots (17), although this activity doesn't seem to be the main focus of the protest.
4. The article mentions that abortion rights advocates are concerned about radical elements among anti-abortion protesters resorting to violence, but it seems that the planned rally will be peaceful. Therefore, I categorized this activity as ""Other activity"" (98)."

9504027,756117,"This news article discusses a landmark case involving the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its regulation of habitat modification. The case, 94-859, has reached the Supreme Court after the government lost in the Federal appeals court.

The disputed regulation prohibits landowners from modifying or degrading the habitat of endangered species in a way that kills or injures wildlife. The regulation defines ""harm"" as going beyond direct force and includes actions that threaten a species indirectly by impairing its ability to breed, find food, or shelter.

The government argues that Congress has revisited the ESA over the years without indicating that it regarded the regulation as an ""interpretation"" rather than the actual text. They also note that the groups challenging the regulation are not disputing any particular enforcement action but have sued to challenge the regulation on its face.

On the other hand, the property rights advocates argue that the regulation is invalid because the word ""harm"" has to be understood in conjunction with the surrounding words, which contemplate direct application of force. They claim that the regulation would apply to unintentional harm caused by a farmer protecting his cornfield, for example, and that this goes beyond Congress's intent.

The Supreme Court justices have raised concerns about the regulation's scope, asking hypothetical questions such as whether a backyard bird watcher could violate the ESA if their activity bothered endangered birds. Justice Scalia has expressed strong doubts about the regulation, stating that it would make anyone who plows their land or looks at birds in their own backyard guilty of ""taking"" an endangered species.

The outcome of this case will have significant implications for property rights advocates and environmentalists alike. If the government loses, there is little chance that Congress will restore the habitat protections, and proposals to amend the ESA may weaken it substantially."

9505002,759830,"The Clinton Administration has announced a new policy regarding Cuban immigration. The agreement states that Cubans leaving in boats for the United States would be taken back to Cuba, and migrants who seek to enter the Guantanamo Bay base illegally will also be returned to Cuba.

This decision seems likely to cost the Administration some Cuban-American support, but the White House has not written off the 25 electoral college votes in Florida. Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, praised the new policy, saying it makes it clear that the United States is in control of its borders and will not allow Fidel Castro to use immigration as a foreign policy weapon.

The decision to admit the 20,000 Cubans currently detained at Guantanamo Bay reverses a vow made by Attorney General Janet Reno last summer that Cubans picked up at sea would never be allowed into the United States. Admission of those Cubans had become a cause for Cuban expatriates in Florida.

However, recognizing that the decision to admit them could set off a new flood of boat people, the Administration said it would in the future return all Cuban boat people who flee the country. This breaks not only with a nine-month-old policy to send boat people to Guantanamo but also with a three-decade policy under which Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro's government were granted entry into the United States.

Cuban-American groups have criticized the decision, saying it goes against their values and will allow Fidel Castro to continue using immigration as a foreign policy weapon."

9505024,761819,"The article reports on a City Council hearing where former employees of the Grand Central Partnership, a social services organization, accused the organization's workers of beating homeless people. The charges were first made to a reporter for The New York Times last month and repeated at the hearing.

One of the three men who made the accusations, Sylvester Williams, had initially recanted his statements but later told the committee that his original accounts were accurate. He stated that he was pressured to recant by Partnership officials and that Frank Schiazza, an associate director of social services, had instructed workers to engage in beatings.

Mr. Schiazza denied the charges ""very passionately"" at the hearing. Nine executives and lawyers for the Partnership also denied the allegations, stating that a policy of violence was not consistent with their organization's rules of outreach.

The article suggests that the controversy surrounding the Grand Central Partnership may be driven by competition for social service funds between the organization and the Coalition for the Homeless, which is advocating on behalf of homeless people. However, Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition, denied any competition and stated that her group had organized testimony from homeless people who claimed to have been attacked by Partnership workers.

The article quotes Committee Chairman Stephen DiBrienza as saying that the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle, suggesting that some form of violence may have occurred despite denials from Partnership officials."
9505065,761819,"The article reports on a City Council hearing where former employees of the Grand Central Partnership alleged that they were part of a team that was instructed by their supervisor, Frank Schiazza, to beat homeless people as part of a policy of violence against those individuals. One of the men who made the allegations, Sylvester Williams, initially recanted his statement but later told the committee that his original statements were accurate and that he had been pressured to recant.

The Partnership's leaders denied the allegations, with some suggesting that the charges were orchestrated by the Coalition for the Homeless, a competing organization, in an effort to discredit the Partnership. The article also notes that nine executives and lawyers for the Partnership denied the beatings ever occurred, while the former employees alleged that the practice was well-known within the staff.

The hearing did not provide any new information or evidence to support or refute the allegations, with Council members expressing frustration at the lack of clarity on the issue. The article suggests that the controversy is likely to continue, with both sides presenting competing narratives and interpretations."

9505035,762950,"The Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968 to prohibit discrimination in housing based on race, and it was amended in 1988 to extend its coverage to people with disabilities. The law requires that ""reasonable accommodations"" be made for disabled renters or buyers.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the exemption from the Fair Housing Act's nondiscrimination requirement does not permit cities to close their single-family zones to group homes. Instead, the restrictions that are exempted must apply uniformly to all residents of all dwelling units.

In the case of City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the city of Edmonds, Washington, which had placed a limit on the number of unrelated people who could live in a house in a single-family zone. The court ruled that the Fair Housing Act's exemption for local occupancy restrictions did not permit such limits.

The decision was seen as important because it clarified the scope of the Fair Housing Act and its application to group homes. It also highlighted the importance of providing reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities.

Some experts argued that the decision could have a significant impact on housing opportunities for people with disabilities, while others saw it as a step backward in terms of expanding housing options for such individuals. The case attracted widespread attention from groups representing the retarded and the elderly, as well as organizations involved with alcoholism and drug abuse.

The Court also issued an unsigned opinion clarifying procedures for evaluating whether a lawyer using a peremptory challenge to remove a potential juror was motivated by bias. This decision overturned a ruling by the Federal appeals court in St. Louis that a Missouri prosecutor had given a ""pretextual"" reason for removing a black juror from the trial of a black man charged with robbery.

Finally, the Court took the unusual step of overturning one of its own precedents, a 1955 ruling that made a Federal law on false statements apply to statements made in court and to Congress. The decision was seen as important because it clarified the scope of the false-statement law and its application to different contexts."

9505046,764095,"This article reports on the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its ongoing battles with politicians and law enforcement agencies over gun control issues. The NRA is an influential organization that has successfully mobilized its members to elect pro-gun candidates and defeat anti-gun legislation.

The article highlights the NRA's defiant stance against President Bill Clinton, who has been a strong advocate for stricter gun control laws. The NRA's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, warned the President that the association will not back down in its efforts to protect Second Amendment rights. LaPierre also defended the NRA's controversial fund-raising letter, which accused Federal gun-control agents of being ""jackbooted government thugs.""

The article notes that the NRA has suffered negative publicity in recent years, particularly following the Oklahoma City bombing and the increased national revulsion for armed violence. However, it suggests that the association remains strong and resilient, with many of its members standing by its cause.

The article also quotes various NRA officials and members who express their determination to continue fighting for gun rights. For example, Tanya K. Metaksa, the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action, warns the President that if he continues to support stricter gun control laws, he will be ""vetoing his Presidency away.""

The article concludes by noting that the NRA's history has shown it to be a formidable force in American politics, and it is unlikely to back down in its efforts to protect Second Amendment rights."

* ""If they are going to argue in Congress that they are a valuable institution to this country, then within their own hallways they have to treat people fairly and equally.""
	+ This quote suggests that Ms. Davis is making an argument or statement about fairness and equality, which falls under category 1: protest information.

Here are some key points I've extracted from this news report:

1. **Racial tension**: The incident highlights simmering racial tensions at the high school, where minority students (20% of the student body) feel segregated and targeted by white students.
2. **Five senior boys suspended**: Five white senior boys were suspended for writing cryptic yearbook captions that spelled out ""Kill All Niggers"" when taken together. Their actions have sparked outrage among students and teachers.
3. **Shocking reaction from school officials**: The school's director of security, Thomas Dianis, was ordered to stay home for the rest of the school year due to his son Keith being one of the suspended students.
4. **Concerns about safety**: Superintendent Dr. John A. Whritner expressed concerns for the safety of both father and son, as well as the potential consequences of their actions.
5. **Diverse reactions from students**: Some students dismissed the incident as a joke or an isolated incident, while others felt deeply offended or even threatened by the coded message.
6. **History of racial incidents**: This is not the first time racial tensions have surfaced at the school. Last year, someone spray-painted a swastika and anti-Semitic messages near the pool, and in April, a fight broke out among students with racial epithets exchanged.
7. **Consequences for the suspended students**: The five students were suspended through the end of exams, unless they successfully appeal their suspension. It remains unclear whether any will graduate with their class.

Overall, this article highlights the need for schools to address and confront racial tensions, biases, and prejudices head-on, rather than simply dismissing them as isolated incidents or jokes."

9507001,772267,"Based on the news article, here are some key points about the protest:

**Background:** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had implemented rules restricting ""indecency"" over television and radio, which was challenged by broadcasters and civil liberties groups.

**Decision:** The court ruled in favor of the FCC's restrictions, upholding its authority to regulate indecent programming on broadcast airwaves. The decision allows the FCC to expand the prohibition on indecent material to midnight from 10 P.M.

**Impact:** The ruling could lead to tighter restrictions on shows like ABC's ""NYPD Blue,"" which contains profane language and nudity, making it less likely to be broadcast during prime-time hours (8-10 P.M.).

**Reaction:**

* Pro-restriction groups praised the decision, saying it protects children from exposure to indecent material.
* Opponents of restrictions, including broadcasters and civil liberties groups, condemned the ruling as a ""major defeat"" that restricts free speech.

**Context:** The ruling comes at a time when Congress is seeking to impose new restrictions on sexual material over television and computer networks. Presidential candidates like Senator Bob Dole are also making attacks on such material a prominent part of their campaigns."

The article highlights the tensions between the Rainbow Family's arrival and the local residents who feel that the event disrupts their way of life.

The language used in the article, such as ""Reincarnated flower children,"" ""Day-Glo peace signs,"" and ""Volkswagen minibuses with their peace signs"" is reminiscent of the hippie culture of the 1960s. The description of the Rainbow Family's encampment, including the ""A"" camp for alcoholics, the Faerie camp for homosexuals, and the Grateful Dead camp, also evokes a sense of nostalgia for the counterculture movement.

The article also touches on themes that were relevant during the 1960s and 1970s, such as environmentalism, social justice, and the clash between different cultural values.

Potts and Cliff Johnson. The article presents a different perspective on the situation, highlighting concerns about the potential environmental impacts and risks associated with spreading sludge fertilizer on arid rangeland.

Kaufman, Assistant to the Director of the Hazardous Site Control Division at the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.), who has expressed concerns about the agency's handling of the case and has asked the Attorney General to name a special prosecutor to investigate. The article also mentions testimony from a former leader of the Lucchese crime family that Merco partners had paid tens of thousands of dollars to the family, which could be seen as a negative influence.

The article presents a more nuanced view of the situation, acknowledging that some people in Sierra Blanca are concerned about the environmental impacts and risks associated with spreading sludge fertilizer, while others see it as an opportunity for economic development.

9510032,798969,"This article discusses the detention of immigrants at New York's airports and the criticisms surrounding the policies. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has been detaining people based on available jail space rather than a rational policy.

The article mentions that since the June 18 uprising at the privately run Esmor center in Elizabeth, NJ, there has been a steep decline in detentions at Kennedy and Newark International Airports. The number of detainees at Kennedy Airport dropped to 57 from 233, while at Newark Airport, it decreased to 5 from 58. Additionally, 675 people were released during the same period, compared to 611 previously.

Critics argue that detention has little effect on controlling illegal immigration and that many of those detained are fleeing persecution in their home countries. They also point out that immigrants are being held for extended periods without a rational basis for detention. One immigration lawyer mentioned a client who was held in detention for seven months before being granted asylum.

The article highlights the need for established criteria regarding who is detained, rather than blanket detentions. The ACLU and other critics argue that the INS needs to establish guidelines for detention, rather than relying on available jail space.

Overall, this article suggests that the current detention policy is based more on available jail space than on a rational approach to stopping illegal immigration."

The Million Man March, organized by Louis Farrakhan, brought over 400,000 African American men to the National Mall in Washington D.C. The event was marked by speeches from prominent black figures, including Maya Angelou and Rev. Jesse Jackson. However, the rally was overshadowed by Farrakhan's lengthy and rambling keynote speech, which drew criticism for its divisive tone and perceived anti-Semitic and racist remarks.

Farrakhan's speech sparked controversy, with some attendees expressing admiration for his message of black pride and responsibility, while others criticized his use of language and perceived biases. The event also generated opposition from some black organizations and prominent figures, including the NAACP and General Colin Powell, who condemned Farrakhan's past remarks as ""racist"" and ""anti-Semitic"".

Despite the controversy, the march was seen as a powerful display of African American solidarity and a call to action for community renewal. The event drew attention to issues such as voter registration and community uplift, and some attendees expressed enthusiasm for the rally's message of hope and empowerment.

Overall, the Million Man March was a complex and controversial event that sparked a range of reactions within the African American community and beyond."

The article highlights the diversity of the crowd, with attendees ranging from business professionals to athletes, trade unionists, and Pan-Africanists. Despite some concerns about potential violence, the march passed off peacefully, with attendees displaying a sense of camaraderie and community.

**Political Backlash**: The statement sparked a political backlash, with Mayor Terence M. Zaleski using it as campaign literature to win support from voters.

**National NAACP Reaction**: Hazel N. Dukes, head of the state chapter of the NAACP, criticized Jenkins' statement, saying he fell into a trap that was political and not serving the kids of Yonkers.

**Jenkins' Defense**: Jenkins defended his stance, saying he had learned that busing more than 17,000 students does not necessarily mean they will receive better education. He also expressed frustration with the city's spending on defending itself against the NAACP lawsuit, which could have been used for books and teachers.

**Criticism from Former NAACP Leader**: Herman Keith, a former head of the Yonkers NAACP branch, criticized Jenkins' stance, saying it was motivated by political ambitions rather than a genuine concern for the community.

**Jenkins' Background**: The article provides background information on Ken Jenkins, including his education and career as a computer training manager. It also mentions his personal life, including his 4-year-old daughter who rides the bus to school.

* Claim of discrimination: The plaintiffs, including the New York Urban League and the Straphangers Campaign, sued the M.T.A. and the state, charging that the disparity in fare increases between city transit riders and suburban railroad users violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act because a majority of Transit Authority riders are black and Hispanic, while suburban railroad users are overwhelmingly white.
* Court ruling: Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. issued a preliminary injunction blocking the fare increase until a trial can be held to settle the question.
* Reaction: The plaintiffs and their allies welcomed the ruling, while M.T.A. officials and government representatives expressed disappointment and frustration.

He has also been quoted as saying that the townships have kept the people in the dark about their activities and are part of a larger conspiracy to advance the cause of global government.

Many residents of Norman Township are opposed to the groups' efforts and see them as a threat to the community's way of life. Some have even formed counter-protest groups to counter the militia's influence.

The article highlights the intense divisions within the township, with some residents supporting the militia's efforts and others vehemently opposing them. The debate has become increasingly heated, with personal attacks and name-calling becoming more common.

Overall, this news article suggests that Norman Township is facing a significant crisis as it struggles to balance its own governance with the demands of outside groups seeking to impose their own brand of democracy."

**Protest/Strike Information:**

* The strike is led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) with 32,500 members.
* The workers are protesting job losses to Boeing suppliers in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as non-union plants in the United States.
* They are also opposing a proposal to require workers to share the cost of their health insurance.

**Protest Location:**

* The protest took place at a stadium where IAMAW union leaders, including President John Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka, and Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson, marched in support of the strikers.

**Union Involvement:**

* IAMAW is merging with the United Steelworkers of America and the United Automobile Workers to form a combined union with two million members.
* Other unions, such as the Teamsters, Carpenters, Seafarers, Food and Commercial Workers, and American Federation of State and Municipal Employees, were also represented at the protest.

**Demands:**

* The strikers are demanding better working conditions, job security, and a reversal of the decline in union membership.
* They believe that Boeing's strong profits and management salaries suggest that the company can afford to keep more jobs at home.

**Quotes from Protesters:**

* ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Boeing's greed has got to go.""
* ""Hey, hey, working people, show the way.""
* ""The pendulum has swung to the bottom. I'm seeing young people treated like labor eunuchs. It's time to organize."" (Tom Crisalli)

9511024,809090,"This article discusses how colleges and universities handle financial aid for students whose parents are divorced or separated, particularly when it comes to contributions from non-custodial parents. Some key points include:

1. Harvard College has a policy of requiring both parents to contribute financially towards their child's education, even if they are no longer together.
2. Other private colleges and universities may also expect both parents to contribute, although the extent of their involvement can vary.
3. Public universities tend to be less insistent on contributions from non-custodial parents, and some institutions do not even ask for information about them.
4. The Federal Government's financial aid application (FAFSA) only requires information about the custodial parent's income and assets, not those of the non-custodial parent.

The article also highlights the challenges that divorced or separated parents can face when trying to navigate the financial aid system, particularly if they have a history of abuse or nonsupport. It notes that exceptions are rare, but that colleges and universities may work with families to develop strategies for covering education costs."

9511026,809214,"Here's the extracted protest information from the news article:

**Protest:** The New York Urban League and the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' group, sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (M.T.A.) and the state, charging that the M.T.A.'s fare increases and allocations of state money violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

**Issues:**

1. **Racial bias:** The plaintiffs claimed that the fare increase disproportionately affected minority communities, which make up more than half of the city bus and subway system's riders.
2. **Unequal subsidies:** The M.T.A. received more subsidies from the state for its commuter railroads, while the city transit system was allocated less.
3. **Discriminatory outcome:** The plaintiffs argued that the fare increase led to a discriminatory outcome, as minority communities were disproportionately affected.

**Key quotes:**

1. ""One of the outcomes of elections is that more or less aid is given to urban areas."" - Jeffrey Glekel, M.T.A.'s lawyer
2. ""What you have here is a situation where the people who have more get more."" - Judge Walker
3. ""I think it's common sense that more justification is required when there's a greater disparity."" - Eric T. Schneiderman, Urban League's lawyer

**Next steps:**

1. The case will likely go to trial before Judge Patterson.
2. A decision on whether to uphold the court order blocking the fare increase is expected by the end of the week at the earliest.

Overall, this protest is about challenging systemic racism and advocating for equal treatment of minority communities in New York City's public transportation system."

9511028,809338,"This article discusses the Welfare Truth Squad, a group of seven men who were previously recipients of general assistance from the state but now speak out to demystify stereotypes about welfare reform. The squad members, led by Mr. Jordan, share their personal stories with church groups, synagogues, rotary clubs, and other organizations to put a human face on the debate over welfare reform.

The article highlights the struggles of Mr. Jordan, who was once employed in a factory but lost his job and had to rely on General Assistance before it was eliminated in 1992. He eventually enrolled in a state aid program called Earnfare, which provided him with a subsidized job for six months, but he has not been able to find permanent employment.

The Truth Squad aims to show that welfare recipients are not just lazy individuals without ambition or dreams, but rather people who deserve a chance to work and provide for themselves. Mr. Jordan emphasizes the importance of having a roof over one's head and the need for job training programs and other initiatives to help those in poverty find employment.

The article also mentions the challenges faced by welfare recipients, including the difficulty of finding jobs, the lack of safety nets, and the struggles of living on a limited income. Despite these challenges, Mr. Jordan remains optimistic and encourages others to work together to create change.

Overall, this article provides a personal and humanizing perspective on welfare reform, highlighting the stories and struggles of those who have been affected by changes in public aid programs."

9511031,810273,"This article is about the controversy surrounding the proposed Ward Valley nuclear waste dump in California. The issue has gained new urgency due to its connection to the Republican budget-reconciliation package, which could allow the project to proceed without further environmental review.

The opponents of the project, including Greenpeace and other environmental groups, are concerned that the dump could contaminate the water table and leak into the nearby river, posing a risk to human health and the environment. They also argue that the area is home to a threatened species, the desert tortoise, and that the construction of the dump would harm their habitat.

The proponents of the project, including U.S. Ecology Inc., argue that the dump would be operated safely and that the environmental risks are minimal. However, opponents point out that U.S. Ecology has had problems at its other waste dumps in the past, which have leaked radioactive materials into the environment.

The article also mentions that American Indians have joined forces with environmentalists to oppose the project, citing cultural and spiritual concerns about the site's sacred status.

The issue is further complicated by the fact that the project's opponents are planning a prolonged protest at the site, with some individuals camping indefinitely in an effort to stop construction. This has led to tensions between protesters and proponents of the project, who view the protesters as trespassers and are concerned about the potential for violence or property damage.

The Models Guild, led by Amie Bongay, has attracted 1,000 applications from models in just three months. The guild aims to provide health insurance, financial services, and a voice for models to protect them from exploitation.

Some of the key issues faced by models include:

* Lack of health insurance: Many models are forced to dip into their own savings or go without medical coverage.
* Unscrupulous agencies: Some agencies prioritize profits over the well-being of their models, leading to exploitation and abuse.
* Long hours and demanding work schedules: Models often work 12-hour days with little rest or respite.
* Limited job security: Models can be dropped by their agencies at any time, leaving them without a steady income.

The article highlights the concerns of some models that the union may not have enough clout to negotiate effectively with employers. However, others believe that the union can provide a sense of community and support for models, as well as advocate for better working conditions and benefits.

Some notable quotes from the article include:

* ""Behind the glamour, there is really a dark side to this profession."" - Amie Bongay
* ""I don't think models' concerns are any different from other people's concerns. They are concerned about pensions, health insurance, getting help for drug abuse."" - Beverly Johnson

The controversy has led to a petition drive calling for his ouster, a stinging 103-to-5 vote of no confidence from his officers, and splits among the City Council along racial lines.

The main issues are:

1. Culture clash: The Chief's style is seen as too harsh and not fitting in with local traditions.
2. Rent discounts: The Chief has refused to accept rent discounts for police officers, citing the department's code of ethics.
3. Perceived racism: Some critics accuse the Chief of being incompetent because he is black.

9512004,812718,"This case involves two men, Paris Carriger and Robert O'Dell, who are scheduled to be executed for murders they allegedly committed in the 1970s. However, their cases have raised significant questions about their guilt and the fairness of their trials.

The prosecution's case against both men relies heavily on the testimony of a single witness, Robert Dunbar, who has a criminal record and has been known to lie. In Carriger's case, Dunbar testified that Carriger had committed the jewelry store murder, but it was later revealed that Dunbar had actually committed the crime himself.

Despite these concerns, both men were convicted and sentenced to death. However, their cases have received widespread attention and criticism from legal scholars and advocates for capital punishment reform.

The case has been taken up by a diverse group of advocates led by distinguished legal scholars who say Carriger deserves a new trial. Michael Radelet, a sociologist and criminologist at the University of Florida, said: ""There have been only two cases of current death row inmates that I've interviewed in the last 12 years where I have publicly gone on record proclaiming their innocence. Paris Carriger is one.""

The case has also received attention from three United States Supreme Court Justices, who voiced concerns about whether Carriger's constitutional rights had been violated at his trial and whether he had been wrongly convicted.

In a statement, the justices said: ""We are deeply troubled by the possibility that Mr. Carriger may have been denied due process and equal protection of the laws in the course of his prosecution.""

The case is now scheduled to be heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond on December 5.

It's clear that there are many questions surrounding both men's cases, including issues with the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses and concerns about whether their trials were fair. The fact that Carriger has never confessed or changed his story, and that new evidence has come to light that could potentially prove his innocence, only adds to the complexity of these cases.

Ultimately, it's up to the courts to determine the guilt or innocence of these men. However, given the concerns surrounding their cases, it's clear that they deserve a thorough review and consideration before any further action is taken."

A gunman, described as a black male around 35 years old and 6 feet tall, stormed into Freddie's record shop, which was owned by Fred Harari, a Jewish man. The gunman had been involved in protests outside the store and had threatened to ""burn and loot"" it.

The gunman began yelling and waving his weapon, ordering everyone except for black customers and a security guard to leave the store. He then fired at least one shot, although it was unclear if anyone was hit. The gunman then splashed flammable liquid around the store, setting fires that quickly spread.

Four trapped men tried to run out of the store but were shot by the gunman. A 23-year-old construction worker was hit near the spine and suffered a shattered spleen, while a man in his 20s was hit in the abdomen and suffered severe injuries. Two other men were also injured, one with a graze wound to the head.

The fire caused dense smoke that filled the store, making it difficult for firefighters to enter the building. The police eventually entered the store after the fire had been contained, finding four bodies on the ground floor at the back. One of the bodies was believed to be that of the assailant, who had been shot in the chest.

In total, seven people were killed in the attack, all believed to be employees of the record shop. The police and fire officials initially thought that all seven died from inhaling toxic fumes from the smoke, but autopsies later confirmed that some may have been shot as well.

This tragic event has left many families devastated, with relatives and friends gathering at the 28th Precinct to wait for news of their loved ones. The investigation into the attack is ongoing, with officials working to determine the motivations behind the gunman's actions."

Explanation: 
- Code 6 refers to ""cross carrying"" which is relevant in this article, as a 12-foot wooden cross was erected by the Ku Klux Klan on the lawn of the Ohio Statehouse.
- Code 20 refers to ""holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing"", which is also relevant in this article, as opponents of the Klan knocked down the cross hours after it was erected, effectively engaging in a form of protest and sign-holding.
- Codes 98 and 99 are used to indicate that other activities or missing activities occurred during this event, but since there wasn't any specific information provided about these activities, I left them blank."

9512034,817479,"Based on the article, I code up to 4 protest activities as follows:

<20 ; 27; 28; 98>

Here's my reasoning:

* 20: Holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing - The lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups are filing a lawsuit to raise awareness about the alleged violation of Miranda rights by the Los Angeles and Santa Monica Police Departments. They are holding signs, picketing, and raising awareness through this protest activity.
* 27: Speechmaking - The article quotes Mark Rosenbaum, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, who is speaking out against the police departments' practices and making a case for why they are wrong.
* 28: Sloganeering/chanting - The lawyers are repeating phrases like ""What is sacrificed when the police deliberately set about to flaunt Miranda is the truth and the confidence of our society"" to emphasize their point and rally support.
* 98: Other activity - While there isn't a specific protest activity mentioned in the article, I'm including this code because the lawyers' actions can be seen as a form of protest or activism."

9512045,818909,"Based on the article, I would categorize the protest activities as follows:

< 20 ; 27; 41 ; 50>

Here's why:

* Code 20 refers to ""holding signs, picket line, placarding, human bill-boarding, informational picketing"". This is reflected in the description of people holding signs and protesting about the exploding toilets.
* Code 27 refers to ""speechmaking references to speech making, speakers, testifying, witnessing, short talk, address, sermon, and so on"". This is reflected in the quotes from Violeta Rivera, Brian O'Dwyer, Edward A. Watkins, and David Golub, which are all forms of public speaking or testimony.
* Code 41 refers to ""polling report of polling attitudes regarding social movement claim"". This is not directly applicable to the article, but it could be argued that the reporting on public opinion about the exploding toilets constitutes a form of polling or attitudinal survey.
* Code 50 refers to ""Describing Project"". This is reflected in the detailed descriptions of the incidents and the lawsuits filed by Brian O'Dwyer."

9512047,819431,"The article discusses a campaign led by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to raise awareness about the treatment of lobsters in the United States lobster industry. The campaign involves buying lobsters from markets and releasing them into the ocean, arguing that boiling them alive is a form of torture.

Industry officials argue that lobsters have a primitive nervous system that does not transmit pain like humans do, and that boiling is the quickest and most humane way to kill them. They also point out that lobsters are cannibals that pull the legs off of crabs before devouring them.

Scientists agree that the best way to minimize the lobster's suffering is to keep it chilled in the refrigerator and put it into rapidly boiling water, or to place it in a freezer for a few minutes before cooking. However, some experts argue that no technique saves the lobster from a painful death.

The article also quotes marine biologist Jelle Atema, who says that while lobsters may not feel pain like humans do, they can still feel discomfort and pleasure. He notes that lobsters have an acute sense of smell and are able to communicate with each other using clicks and whistles.

The campaign has been met with ridicule by some in the lobster industry, who argue that it is a joke and that lobsters are just another food source. However, others see it as a legitimate concern about animal welfare and the treatment of crustaceans.

Overall, the article highlights the complex ethical issues surrounding the treatment of lobsters and other animals in the food industry."
